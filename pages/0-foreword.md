# foreword

Books that concern themselves with the future are always in danger of making themselves a mockery. This is particularly true of books that depict events in the near future, so I am putting myself, deliberately, in a situation where derision is likely. To lessen the inevitable effects, I have taken some precautions to help avoid almost immediate anachronism.

Firstly, this book is not intended to be prophetic. I have no crystal ball. Secondly, the time it is set if uncertain. I suggest it could be set anywhere from five to twenty years in the future. Lastly, I have based the science on currently existing technology.

I hope you enjoy it and are not too dismissive if my depiction of the future is not quite right.
