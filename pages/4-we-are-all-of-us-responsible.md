In Wellington, I met with Lia in a number of locations. A favourite was a hipster cafe on Cuba Street. We never met anywhere that was not a neutral venue. I never learnt where she lived. Our conversations that stretched over a week had none of the intimacy of sharing that my sessions with Melvin had. She had no trust me. She still felt vulnerable to me I assume.

We discussed, on the third occasion, again in the cafe, when her life fell apart. This was a hard session as she squarely blamed the outcome on me. I of course refute this as misdirecting the truth. In fact, by the point where she because at risk, she was no longer of any significant use to me or those I was working with. She had already shared the nature of some of the people in the Bright Futures organisation, and had gathered evidence of their started extremism. This was more than enough mud for us to sling and make the media and people at large question Bright Future's goals.

But, Lia carried on, digging; worse for her was that she had connected fully with the crackpots she had got the information from and about.

It was as if she had enjoyed the thrill of the covert activities she was undertaking. She worked for them and against them.

They consisted of six people. [Names] Four of which had worked directly at Bright Futures, the other two indirectly. They had taken on a self-appointed role of disrupting the flow of information about Bright Futures reaching a wider audience. They also wanted to stop some of the investigations that were in flight on the technology.

...

Once the story broke it left Lia in peril. Her name was included in the list of perpetrators. She was wanted by the American authorities. She manages to get back into New Zealand using a British passport and lies low, avoiding the police,

the security of the company she was trying to attack and by those who coerced her into it.

Ends with Lia turning off her Gate; her mind quietens and the mass of input fades to nothing.
