[Godwin wraps up and claims a victory.]

So, that is my story. Or is is my story of the stories that make up what happened. I think you will agree that they are complete and that they are a better version than that played out in the media, for the lurid and sensational reasons that it had.

The future. Does it belong to likes of Lia and Gray, or to Melvin? Is it a Bright Futures future where the likes of Raphaella plays God to us mortals? Where in this future is there a place for Joan, or even Vi? Where is my place?

My future is missing Sally. I think that in my future there is no Sally. In my future Sally is already in another future, she will be outside of our time. The horror of her life is a thing of the past; her life now, if that is how we describe it, is something else, something none of us who shared here can understand. She is now inscrutable, we cannot imagine or empathise with her thoughts as they are so different from us. She is an exotic intelligence.
