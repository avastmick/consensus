MY NAME IS CHARLES GODWIN. I am a forgetful old man with a clouded and uncertain mind. Luckily, the past is still clear, and I remember it well. Those memories are still vivid and have a vitality that my decrepitude does not diminish. I wander back through them and look back to when events made deep impressions, to when I was in my early thirties. I spend much of my time now back then. It was a golden age, see. I was in my prime, and everything was exciting, it was full of vibrant possibilities. It was the very best time to be young, and I have a deep ache in my heart at its passing. God, I loved that time! It had that heady mix of excitement and apprehension that invigorated you. The air was filled with social revolution. It was just starting. If you were paid to do any repetitive task, a machine was going to replace you. Soon, countless were put out of their jobs by the efficient mix of artificial intelligence, automation and robotics. No matter how cheap your local human workforce, it could not compete with machines that never ate, slept nor had a holiday.

And the people of the time felt it too, a simmering anxiousness about their future. Their reason to be, their work, their lives, was being eroded by technology and automation. They lashed out and demonstrated their angst, their malcontent. They struck at those historically familiar to them. They marched and protested against globalisation, immigration, religions and even whole countries they'd never visited nor knew much about. But, they mistook their real enemy. They were distracted by the petty things and were re-enacting old battles long settled. The real threat remained obscured as if a hidden hand were at work. And, of course, it was. There was the grandest of conspiracies.

In the end, it wasn't intelligent machines that would change the world. While people were preoccupied with automation and the loss of jobs, in the background stalked a greater threat. Not long after I had left university, a few years before this time of change, I had read a lot about biological experiments being conducted - sadly to rats and monkeys. Incredible things were done to these creatures' brains. These were not done for the sake of medical science, though many claimed they were. No, they were meddling with biology and hell-bent on the goal of a new, improved human. The practitioners of this were called *Transhumanists* and they intended to change the world. 

They did.  

I was terrified of the world this could bring. To fight it I founded the *Human Association*. Its goal was to assure humanity's future and publicise the incredible threat *Transhumanism* brought to society. In my mind, the tragedy I saw happening was not merely in the lost livelihoods, but in the loss of what it meant to be human. But, to most people at the time, the concepts of *Transhumanism* and *bio-hacking* were still seen as a joke - no more than dreams wished for by crackpots and adolescent boys. I so wish now they had taken it seriously; we could have been stopped then. Instead, the opportunity was lost. We fought for the ordinary person; we fought for them to have a future.

We failed.

Not long afterwards, some supporters came to me. They asked me to write a book of the events that had taken place. To tell the truth, I was not too keen at first - I felt that my part was too small and too many events were hidden from me. But, an idea came to me. I would travel and meet the people involved - those who had a better view of what happened. Through them, I pieced together a story that spanned the globe, from New Zealand to Shanghai, from London to California. It was to my mind a great story, and the people involved knew that too. Otherwise, why would they want to meet me and tell their part in it? Even those who I had hurt had come forward, tentatively, and gave their account. We all wanted to rights some wrongs, I suppose. No one wants to live their life the villain, and many of us were thought to be that. To paraphrase a dear friend of mine: there were no black hats in this story, nor any white. We were all of us to blame for what happened.
