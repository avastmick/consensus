# Prologue
THE FUTURE RARELY MEETS ONES EXPECTATIONS. It is often a let-down, a pale version of the vibrant possibilities one had in mind. And so it was for me. 

My name is Charles Godwin, and I thought the future was going to be a place of wonder and rich potential. I was in my early thirties and felt it was the very best time to be alive. It was exciting, with so much change in the air - tomorrow looked bright. But, when the future I wished for arrived, I found I had no place in it. 

The people of the time knew it before I did. They had a simmering anxiousness about the future. Their reason to be, their work, their lives, was being eroded by technology and automation. If a person was paid to do any repetitive task, a machine was going to replace them. Soon, countless were put out of their jobs by an efficient mix of artificial intelligence, automation and robotics. No matter how skilled or cheap a nation's local human workforce, it could not compete with machines that never ate, slept nor had a holiday.

Threatened workers lashed out and demonstrated their angst, their malcontent. They marched and protested against globalisation, immigration, religions and even whole countries they'd never visited nor knew much about. They struck at those historically familiar to them and re-enacted old battles long settled; but they mistook their true enemy. The real threat remained obscure, as if a hidden hand were at work. And, of course, it was. There was the grandest of conspiracies.

In the end, it wasn't intelligent machines that would change the world. While people were preoccupied with automation and the loss of jobs, in the background stalked a greater threat. I had read a lot about biological experiments being conducted, a few years before this time -- sadly to rats and monkeys. Remarkable things were done to these creatures' brains. They were being altered, not done for the sake of medical science, though many claimed they were. No, they were meddling with biology and hell-bent on the goal of a new and improved human. The practitioners of this were called *Transhumanists* and they intended to change the world. \
They did.  

I was terrified of the world these people would bring. To fight them I founded the *Human Association*. Its goal was to assure humanity's future and publicise the incredible threat *Transhumanism* brought to society. In my mind, the tragedy I saw unfolding was not merely in the lost livelihoods, but in the loss of what it meant to be human itself. Unfortunately, to most people at the time, the concepts of *Transhumanism* and *bio-hacking* were still seen as a joke - no more than dreams wished for by crackpots and adolescent boys. I so wish now they had taken it seriously; they could have stopped it then. Instead, the opportunity was lost. We fought for the ordinary person; we fought for them to have a tomorrow worth living. \
We failed.

Not long afterwards, some supporters came to me. They asked me to write a book of the events that had taken place. To tell the truth, I was not too keen at first -- I felt that my part was too small and too many events were hidden from me. But, an idea came to me. I would travel and meet the people involved -- those who had a better view of what occurred -- and through them, I would piece together a story that spanned the globe, from New Zealand to Shanghai, from London to California. It was to my mind a great story, and the people involved knew that also. Otherwise, why would they want to meet me and tell their part in it? Even those who I had hurt had come forward, and gave their account. Two years had passed since the events that threw us all together, and their anger at me had lessened.

We all wanted to rights some wrongs too, I suppose. No one wants to live their life the villain, and many of us were still thought by others to be just that. To paraphrase a dear friend of mine: there were no black hats in this story, nor any white. We were all of us to blame for what happened.

##### *Postscript*

*What follows here is that book. I recorded many of the meetings I had and tried to be as accurate as possible in transcription. The dialogues transcribed took place when I travelled to meet the people involved a year or more after the events of the story. In some cases, and where I could, they tell the story directly, in their own words, with only my editorial alteration.*

*I could not publish the book then, as hoped, but now, years later, with all those involved gone or dead, I can.*
