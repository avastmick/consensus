<span class="firstLetter">M</span>Y NAME IS CHARLES GODWIN. I am a forgetful old man with a clouded and uncertain mind. Luckily, the past is clear and I remember it well. Those memories are still vivid and have a vitality that my decrepitude does not diminish. I wander back through them to when events made deep impressions, to when I was in my early thirties. I spend much of my time back then. It was a golden age. I was in my prime and everything was exciting, it was full of vibrant possibilities. It was the very best time to be young, and I have a deep ache in my heart at its passing.

It was a time of great change. But, mixed with the excitement, was an air of apprehension about the future. A social revolution was under way. It was just the starting then. If you were paid to do any repetitive task, a machine was going to replace you. Soon, countless people were put out of their traditional jobs by an efficient mix of artificial intelligence, automation and robotics. No matter how cheap your local human workforce, it could not compete with machines that never ate, slept nor had a holiday.

But, it wasn't intelligent machines that would change the world. While people were preoccupied with automation and the loss of jobs, in the background stalked a greater threat. Not long after I left university, I read a lot about biological experiments being done, usually to rats and monkeys - incredible things, I felt. These weren't being done for the sake of medical science, though many claimed they were. No, they were meddling with biology with the goal to make a new, improved human. The practitioners of this were called *Transhumanists* and they intended to change the world. 

They did.

In my mind, what I saw was not lost livelihoods, but the loss of what it meant to be human. It was not a popular sentiment at the time. The concepts of *Transhumanism* and *bio-hacking* were seen as a joke to most - some fringe activity wished about by crackpots and adolescent boys. It was not real to most people. I wish now they had only taken it seriously; it could have been stopped then. There was a simmering anxiousness in people during that period, and I hoped it would all boil over and be a tide to wash away all that stuff. The people felt something. Their reason to be, their work, their lives, was being eroded by technology and automation. This new threat was to compound their woes further and make them even less significant. But when the people did lash out and demonstrated their angst, their malcontent, they mistook their real enemies. They instead struck at those more historically familiar to them. They marched and protested against globalisation, immigration, religions and even whole countries they'd never visited nor knew much about. They were distracted by the wrong things and were re-enacting old battles long settled. The opportunity was lost. It vanished from view as if a hidden hand were at work. And, of course, it was. It was the grandest of conspiracies.

The wealthiest of that time were willing to take the greatest of gambles - they lay their bets on the future of humanity itself. They desired to fiddle with the fabric of our being. They were arrogant and their intentions pure vanity. They wished to cheat death and make themselves immortal. They believed they could do a better job than the exquisite evolutionary engineering that produced us. They turned their backs on millions of years of fine-tuning that made us who we were and what we had. We had, and some of us still have, a vital spark, a bright light within us that shone out and threw back the dark of the world. No other creature had that, only we did, and it set us apart. These people sought to extinguish it through their ignorance and hubris. 

I was terrified of what was happening. To fight it I founded the *Human Association*. Its goal was to assure humanity's future and publicise the incredible threat *Transhumanism* brought to society. We fought for the ordinary person; we fought for them to have a future. We struggled against those who thought they were better than we were.

We failed.

Not long afterwards, some supporters came to me. They asked me to write a book of the events that had taken place. To tell the truth, I was not too keen at first - I felt that my part was too small and too many events were hidden from me. But, I then had an idea. I would travel and meet those people who had a better view of what happened. Through them, I would piece together a story that spanned the globe, from New Zealand to Shanghai, from London to California. It was to my mind a great story, and the people involved in it knew that too. Otherwise, why would they want to meet me and tell their part in it? Even those who I had hurt the most had come forward, tentatively, and gave their side of things. We all wanted to rights some wrongs, I suppose. No one wants to live their life the villain. To paraphrase a dear friend of mine: there were no black hats in that story, nor any white. We were all to blame for what happened.
