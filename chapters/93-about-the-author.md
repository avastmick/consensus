MICHAEL W CLARKE WAS BORN ON A TRAIN between Carterton and Wellington, New Zealand, sometime during 2016. The man he was before decided he needed a change; he was tired of the person he had become. So he moved from a small farm, in rural New Zealand, to one of the largest cities in the world. It was like being transported to the future. For that future he needed to make himself new again.
