As you can probably tell, I could have spent hours and hours with Gray. By rights, she should hate me, or at least be so suspicious of me. But she was nothing as I had expected. She had a Zen-like charm and the calm that produced was infectious. I had wanted her to stay that evening, I really had, but she had left not long after midnight. The taxi was already waiting outside. She hugged me, I felt her firm body press against me, briefly, and then she left, into the drizzling rain. I watched the car reverse and trundle off, away along the cobbles of the mews.

Next day, Melvin had arranged for us to meet his daughter Joan, Sally's mother. The calm that the conversations with Gray had created, would be soon broken by this thin, whining woman who did her utmost to undo all the sympathy you had for her, because of what had happened. I arrived sometime after ten o'clock at Melvin's house. Joan was already there and already angry with me.

"You are late, Mr Godwin." She looked at me as if I was covered in shit. Her nose was lifted and her eyes had a pained expression. Caused it seemed by looking at me. 'Ah, Gray, where are you, when I need you?' I though to myself. We were ushered by Melvin into the same room I had met him the times I had come to see him. He seemed anxious and irritated. I sat on the leather sofa and was joined by Melvin, who theatrically leant back into the sumptuous seat, his hands on his head, their fingers entwined, holding on for dear life.

"Please sit down, Joan, you're making the place look untidy," Melvin said, flatly, to his daughter. She sat, twisted, on the arm of the matching leather chair opposite, her arms folded across her flat chest. "Okay, Charles, what questions do you have for us today? I think Joan will have an interesting angle on events. Obtuse to mine at least!"

I wanted to leave. It was so tense. The room felt stifling. "Thank you both for meeting me. I know, Joan, that it is not easy." She frowned at me and then stared away across the room. "What I'd love to have is an anecdote, a story, that helps me understand how you you both coped with what happened to Sally. Maybe something that made you closer?" The word hung in the air. Closer, they couldn't have been so obviously further apart.

"Why are you doing this Godwin? You run out of money or something?" Joan's voice was hard and sneering. Melvin let his hands slip from his head. He leant forwards, "Joan, we've spoke about this. Charles is trying to work this all through. It's not for money, God, he seems rich enough, and if we don't like what he comes out with, it gets buried. That's right, isn't it Charles?" I nodded, "That's right. The business of before is finished, I have no intention of going back there. I doubt anyone would be interested in *my* side of the story. So, to close everything out, I thought I'd get everyone else's point of view. I have some people who are interested in publication - you know serialisation in a national paper, that sort of thing, maybe TV. Anything made, goes straight to Sally, to help with her long-term care. You both won't be always here to help her, you know that."


"Put these on," Melvin stands over Joan, holding a large, black pair of goggles.
"What are they?"
"Virtual reality goggles. I want to show you something."
"Really?" Impatient and patronising she sighs as she reaches out from the smooth matt black goggles. "What do I do, just put them on?"
"Yes, just put them on. It will be dark. Push the ear piece into your ear."
Another sigh and slips the goggles over her head. There is nothing to see. She pushes the earpieces into her ears. *This better be good.*
"Hello mum."
"Who's that?"
"It's me, Sally."
"Oh God! You can speak now? My baby!" Tears pooled along the edges of her eyes, causing a sprinkling of tiny lights across her vision.
"I can speak mum. Relax. Are you ready?"
"For what, baby?"
"For me!" Another light at the centre of her vision appeared. She blinked rapidly. Her hand reached out and waved urgently at the outside room.
"What is it? Sally, sweetheart?" The light grew from the point in front of her and started to form a shape. A distant figure was moving towards her. It moved like a mirage, waving in an imagined haze. Then it became solid, a person, a girl. Sally.
Joan ripped the goggles from her head. The one ear-piece tugging hard at her ear, stinging.
"What is this dad? God what is this?" The goggles fell the floor. Joan's hands covered her face as if in terror at what could be seen. She sobbed; her shoulders moving up and down in sharp spasms of grief.
Grandad stooped to rescue the fallen goggles and quickly swung them up onto his own head. He afixed the ear-pieces.
"Sally? I'm sorry. Your mum got a shock."
"Is she okay?" The little girl stood there, in her favourite blue and grey dress, upon a black plain with no obvious end. Her dark hair was perfectly combed into two neat bunches either side of her head, each held in place with a matching blue bow.
"Sure, she's fine. Just a shock. We should have warned her it would happen. Silly really. Hey that dress is going to getting too small isn't it. That's what you wore at your mum's birthday three years ago!"
"It's mum's favourite. Mine too. I wore last summer, before I was sick." She smiled, an uncertain smile.
"Hey! Look at you with your new smile. I bet that dress was a struggle to get into last summer!" He laughed out loud.
He felt a touch on his arm and removed the goggles. Joan was looking up at him, her eyes wet and puffy with her make smudged. "Hang on, Sally."
"I'm sorry." Joan said, "I don't know. Is it really her? I can't see her like this." She sniffed dabbing at her smeary eyes.
"She cannot see you yet. We are working on it. She says she looks at a picture she has for each of us, so I guess it's like Skype when one person has their video turned off. Here, try again." He offered the goggles to her and she took them. Grandad helped her put them on and insert the ear-pieces.
"Hello sweetheart. Sorry, you gave mum such a fright."
"It's okay mum." She laughed.
"You monkey, you think it's funny making your mum scared like that!" She laughed too; they both laughed together for the first time for a long time.
"Do you like my my dress? Grandad said it would be too small now. But I can do anything here!" She stuck her tongue out. "That's to grandad!" and she laughed again.
"The dress looks lovely. You ignore grandad, sometimes he's just rude! I love the way you've done your hair - very cute." Joan felt herself tighten up, she so just wanted to hold her child, pick up the cute little girl before her. She felt her hands go out in a mock cuddle. "Do you know what I am doing?"
"No, what?" Sally grinned.
"I'm giving you a big cuddle." Tears started to flow again and Sally was blurred through the wet of her eyes.
"I'd like that. Grandad's friend says we can work on that. I can see hear and see now."
"I'd love that too. For now we'll just have to imagine."
"Okay."
"You know what?"
"What?"
"Grandad's right. That dress would never do up!"
"Mum!"
"What? You're ten now! Big girl."

Sally and her mother re-connect. It is beautiful.

But the lack of control Joan has over Sally and all that is happening makes her bitter. She hates the digital means of connecting to Sally, worse though she has lost her immediate role of what she sees is a mother: a guide and instructor, someone who tells the child what she needs to do.
