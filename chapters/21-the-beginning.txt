# Chapter 21 - The beginning

<!-- 
Godwin wraps up and claims a victory, and fires a warning.

Narrative:
    This is intended by Godwin to be the end of the story. It is succinct and self-knowing.
    1. He loves Gray and that is a challenge
    2. He admires Melvin and what he did to keep Sally alive, against all the odds. He joins Gray as someone who is ushering in a new order, a new type of human
    3. He dismisses Lia, and agrees with Gray, and thinks she is a *wannabe* who is really in the same camp as he is himself.
    4. He sees the future as two camps now.

The two camps:
    1. The new
    2. The old

Godwin sees conflict ahead. He hopes that his story and his *balance* in telling it, where he started and where he ended it, will help people see some sense and stand down from a fight no one can win.

So, that is my story. Or is is my story of the stories that make up what happened. I think you will agree that they are complete and that they are a better version than that played out in the media, for the lurid and sensational reasons that it had.

The future. Does it belong to likes of Melvin and Gray, or to myself and Lia? Is it a *Bright Futures* future where the likes of Raphaella plays God to we mortals? Where in this future is there a place for Joan, or even Vi? Where is *my* place?

My future is missing Sally. I think that in my future there is no Sally. In my future Sally is already in another future, she will be outside of our time. The horror of her life is a thing of the past; her life now, if that is how we describe it, is something else, something none of us who shared here can understand. She is now inscrutable, we cannot imagine or empathise with her thoughts as they are so different from us. She is an exotic intelligence.
