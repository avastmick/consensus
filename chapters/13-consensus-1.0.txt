"I'm sorry. The vote was unanimous. The board feel that there is too close a relationship between the recovery of Sally and the business of the company. There are rumours that you used company resources and employees to help with the integration of Sally to the Internet."
"The code used is open source. There are a couple of dev labs that specialise in this stuff. They helped."
"That's illegal."
"No it is not. The act of an unlicensed use of a Gate is illegal, or rather the person installing the Gate is operating outside of the law. The law says nothing about software or the person receiving the Gate."
"It's a shady area. So you are saying that no employees were used?"
"Not to my knowledge."
"Come on, that's a convenient line."
"I can't control what employees do in their own time by their own volition."
"Their contracts do. They are clear on working outside of the company while in our employ."
"Look, you want me gone - fine. You try to get me out to save money and try and not pay me out?Â¦ It won't end well. Sally is very public you know. I can't imagine shareholders liking that story."
"Okay, let's not go there. Listen, let's get to the real point. There are some on the board who want to know about your relationship with Bright Future."
"BFC provided the Gate and the technical team that implanted it into Sally. They provided a consultant ///woman who assisted in connecting to Sally. They're good, professional. I trust them as I know what they want and why they put forward so much resource."
"You aren't involved with their business?"
"No, I guess I am their customer."
"You paid for their assistance?"
"No, as I said, it's pretty clear why they'd help. The publicity alone is worth whatever I could pay them. They're looking pretty good right now."
"That's the problem. Some on the board and certain large shareholders are not happy about this..."
"You mean that Godwin clown."
"Among others."
"Look I'm a pretty straightforward businessman. I don't get the issue. We produce software and sell software services. We're doing well. I can't see that Sally's story will affect that; there's such thing as bad publicity, as they say. And BFC are in no way an issue, they are not a competitor. Not even remotely. Sorry, you say let's get to the real point. You're not. Come on say what you've been sent to say."
"This isn't about business, it's about morals. Many on the board and many shareholders have expressed clearly they think you've overstepped a line."
"You're fucking kidding me? I've overstepped a moral line to save the life of my granddaughter? What the fuck?"
"Have you saved her life? Or have you done something else? We tried to warn you last time we met. You've been used by an organisation to further their agenda. They used your daughter to have a story about how humankind can now cheat death."
"What I'm playing God. Oh for fucks sake, *really*? This is due to some religious nutjobs who own our stock. You think BFC used me? They saved my granddaughter!"
"Not BFC, Bright Future, the parent organisation. They are pushing a transhuman agenda. You've given them the ultimate trojan horse."
"Get out. Just get the fuck out. You've gone fucking insane. Pay me off, otherwise this will be spilled across the media and you'll be a fucking laughing stock."
"Will we? Not a lot of people like the idea of transhumanism. People don't like change. People won't like at all the idea that this change is against everything they've ever known."
