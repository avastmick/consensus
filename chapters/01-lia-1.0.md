# Chapter 1 

<span class="firstLetter">I</span> WAS TOO YOUNG THEN TO CONCEDE DEFEAT. Not long after my fall, some supporters of mine had come and asked me to write a book of the events that led up to it. To tell you the truth, I was not too keen at the time, but I agreed anyway, just to keep going. I suppose I wanted to make sense of it, and also to rights some wrongs. I felt at then I was unfairly made the villain by some, and I was not that. To paraphrase a dear friend of mine: there were no black hats in this story, nor any white. We were all to blame for what happened, and the only way to show that was to tell it as it happened.

So, I set off and travelled widely to meet with the people involved, the major players if you will. I pieced together through them a story that spanned the globe, from New Zealand to Shanghai, from London to California. It was to my mind a great story, and the people involved in it knew that too. Otherwise, why would they want to meet me and tell their part in it? Even those who I had hurt the most had come forward, tentatively at first, and gave their all. 

One of these was Lia Cox. I travelled all the way to New Zealand to see her and hear her side of things. A mutual friend had to broker the meeting as Lia did not want anything to do with me. But she was convinced; she was sold on the idea that she could tell it from her angle and that it wouldn't be me telling it, as such. She would give her account, and I would add it to my book - it would be her words on the page, with only a few insights from my good self. 

It all started with Lia when I was head of the *Human Association*. Its goal was to publicise the threat *Transhumanism* brought to society. We were looking for someone who could show the horrors. Lia was that person. We had been tipped off by her boyfriend, or rather ex-boyfriend, Kyle. He sent a private message to the account *@H+CONCERNED*, that we were running at the time. Kyle told us that Lia was flying to Shanghai to have surgery to insert a device into her brain. He didn't have any real details, but he was worried about her. He was desperate, he said. We told him that we'd help find her and give her any assistance we could. In return, he gave us her flight number, a fair few photos, as well as her various social media usernames. Lia was a prize to us. She was the first instance of someone at this stage; others we knew of, indirectly, had already had the work done. By that point, they were of no use. Lia was different. If we could convince her to work with us, she could help create problems for the Transhumanists. We could also use her to let the local authorities in China know about her surgeon, Dr Li, and close down his operation. 

When I caught up with Lia a couple of years later in New Zealand, I met her a few times over a week-long stay in Wellington. Of all the people I met, she was the hardest to talk to. She had no trust in me, and that was fair I suppose. The first meeting was in a cafe, right in the centre of town. It was quiet when we met, and at first, she was almost monosyllabic. So, to warm things up a bit, I told her story in Shanghai from our perspective and hoped she would jump right and fill in the detail. We settled into a nook in the corner, on comfy seats. I hoped we would be there a long while.

"I'm glad you came, Lia," I said.
"Gray convinced me. I still think you're a prick, Godwin. You better keep your side of the bargain. You recording this?"
"I am," I said, and I placed my phone in the centre of the table between us. Silence fell between us. Lia looked sullen and moody and young - like a teenager. "Shall I start? You know, when Susan and I got to Shanghai? You can take over. It might give us some flow. Let's see how it goes, aye?"
"Okay. Whatever," Lia replied.
"So, we arrived in Shanghai not knowing what we were going to do. We didn't have a plan, not in any detail," I started. "We were to follow you Lia to find Dr Li. Beyond that, the mechanics of it, we had no idea. See, we weren't spies, or agents of a secret conspiracy, as some have made out to be. We were a small group that believed in something. At best, we were passionate amateurs. We were lucky ones at that. We made stupid mistakes, but somehow we managed to get to you. Things just went our way, I guess. Firstly, we thought we could follow you from the airport to your hotel. The airport is a long way from the city, as you know. We hadn't thought it through - how would we convince one taxi to follow another? Even if we found an actual driver, we had no Chinese between us. So, when you came out of from the arrivals hall, you didn't go for the taxi exit, you went for the Maglev exit instead. We found it simple to follow someone on public transport. I would have been a disaster otherwise.

"We managed to track you from the airport to your hotel. You looked anxious. It made following you easier. You stood out. Look, you were in a foreign country with no grasp of the language or culture. You were going to have a piece of metal inserted into your skull by someone you'd never met. Of course, you were anxious. The fact that the streets were not as crowded as we had anticipated helped us too. Shanghai was such a vast metropolis, a mega-city, yet it had a calm, Zen-like air I thought. It lacked the tense, aggressive, chaos of places like Mumbai, or Mexico City. That said, it wasn't a strict order like Singapore either; it was organic. Along the streets, riders on hired electric scooters ran, almost silently, in all directions, at speed. Young and excited adults rode bicycles in loose groups, their numbers a defence against any dangers. Buses and Taxis pushed through them all at an even pace. They swam through them like whales through shoals of colourful fish. The bikes and scooters parted at the last possible moment. Any stragglers that separated from the group sped up to rejoin, while the taxi or the bus would slow down patiently. There was an easy pace to it all if you were attuned to it; it was pleasant. If you weren't, like you weren't Lia, progress along the streets was perilous and nerve-wracking. You walked more in the street than on the pavement. The small shops, selling everything from noodles to scooters to electrical parts, spilt out over the pavement and forced you off. Rows of bikes were parked on there; scooters rode along it. It made it hard to get through. You jumped from side to side, making yourself more visible against the street flow. We walked along, in almost plain sight, following you. You didn't even notice us.

After a while, you stopped. You compared a street sign against some details on your phone. You turned down that road. It too was lined with small shops, this time selling crockery, tea, fruit and haircuts. Music blared out of the hairdressers, two hot looking young girls, wearing bright pink sashes, stood to attention outside. Next to it, opposite a narrow alley, was an office. Its purpose was not evident. Above the door, 'Twelf', was written, and underneath that, '十二号'. When I looked up I could see it was an office block, at least 20 stories high. From my position, it looked dusty and disused. You went in, and we didn't see you again for some days.

"What happened when you went in, Lia? Can you fill in what happened next?" Lia frowned and stared at the table. I thought she wasn't going to say anything.
"Inside the office was empty," Lia said, breaking the silence. "Opposite the front door was an office desk. On top, was this huge old CRT computer monitor with matching beige keyboard and mouse. It was like something from the nineteen-nineties. I was thirty minutes early, so I guessed no one was expecting me yet. It didn't look seedy or anything, but disused, and a bit dusty. In the corner was this other door. When I opened it, I could see it led downstairs. The stairs were well lit and clean, so I went down. It smelt of fresh paint. At the bottom was another door which was half-open. Beyond that a renovated office that was modern, clean and efficient looking. That is where I first met Dr Li." 

"I was completely surprised by the clinic and Shanghai. In my mind, I had this vision of a rain-washed, humanity crammed, squalid Asian city. You know, a back street affair, where the surgery would be done under a naked lightbulb by a grubby man in a blood-stained white t-shirt. It was not like that *at all*, and I had felt relieved, I can tell you. Dr Li had said to me, 'Hey, this is not like Bladerunner, is it?' He had laughed, I remember, his sweet laugh. 'It's okay, everyone thinks because this is China and we are doing sci-fi stuff, this must be like a sci-fi movie! This is Shanghai; it's very modern.' I reckon he was very proud of his city. He came across as this genuine and likeable man. He calmed me down; I don't know why.

"The operation went fine. This woman had shown up not long after I first got there. She was the anaesthetist. She seemed competent. They prepped me. Dr Li shaved an area on the back of my head where my crown is. It was a circle about the width of my fist. They then made me have a shower and put one of those gapey hospital gowns and paper knickers. They then took me into a small, clean room with a trolley bed. I lay down on it, face down. The woman gave me an injection, and I slipped away with Dr Li holding my hand, saying soothing rubbish that I can't remember anymore."

When Lia woke, her head hurt. "A dragging ache, though, not a sharp pain," she told me. "I asked Dr Li if everything had gone well. He said, 'Of course, I've done this many times now.' He then turned and lifted up the hair at the back of his head. There was a *Gate*! Dr Li also had a *Gate*. That made me feel a lot better. To know the person who had drilled a hole in my head and attached something to my brain had also had the same work done was comforting. You know, like getting a tattoo from someone with great tats", Lia said. "I just drifted in and out, sleeping and dozing, for hours, I guess. Then, I was hungry and thirsty. He came in with this sweet tea drink in a gaudy bottle and a brown paper bag with this flat savoury pancake. I guzzled the bottle and stuffed the pancake down. I could have had anything, and it would have been good, but it was *exactly* the right thing at that time. I felt better. My focus then centred on the back of my head. I remember reaching my hand around. Dr Li took my hand. I could feel something there, a cold and smooth metal. He then showed me his work. I sat in a chair in front of a mirror, like in a hairdressers. He held up another mirror behind my head. It showed the bald circle on my head. In the centre was a metal ring. The skin around it was pink and sore looking, with regular lines of stitches radiating out like the points of a star. He told me, 'It will ache for a couple of weeks and itch very badly for a month or more. But after a couple of months, you won't notice it. Trust me. You must try to keep it clean. And don't bang it on anything until it has fully healed. Sleeping will not be easy. So, take it easy for a while. Take one of these, every day until they are gone.' He shook a bottle of pills at me. He then wiped the area down, cleaning it.

"I spent a few hours there, with Dr Li. He was so friendly. 'You good now,' he assured me. 'Now I show you how to connect. Okay?' He held up a smooth cylinder. 'This connects you to the Internet.' He pushed a small button on the side. It flashed a tiny blue light. 'You can pair this to your phone, easy for you I think. Okay?' He then leant me forward and pressed the cylinder into the hole in the centre of the metal circle. I felt it click in. He gave me my phone, and I searched for a new device. There was only one listed. I clicked 'Connect', and I felt my mind flash for a moment. It was a strange feeling. Not anything too special, but strange. I wasn't sure how I was supposed to feel. 'Relax. I will come back in a while. Your brain will work out what to do. Then you need to learn what to do with that. You will be exhausted.' He left me. He was right I did feel tired. If I closed my eyes, I could see words hanging in the dark, behind my eyelids. I remember drifting off.

"Dr Li came back and woke me. I had no idea of the time, or what was happening. He smiled at me, 'See, I told you it would make you sleepy. I have got you a taxi. You go back to your hotel. Relax and sleep for a week. You will work it out. Once you get on the Internet, email me. Yes?' I was so dopey and confused, I agreed. He put a surgical pad over the area on the back of my head. I put a loose hat over it all. He helped me out of the clinic and bundled me into the taxi. It knew where to go. I must have drifted off in the cab; I woke outside the hotel. The concierge was shaking my arm to wake me. I went up to my room and slept for two days straight. I never saw Dr Li again. I was supposed to go back and see him a week later. But of course, I never did, did I? I received a message not to come back. He was gone. Thanks to you, Godwin." Lia stared at me for a moment, as if she was about to continue. She didn't.

"Look, I've got to go," she said. "Let's pick this up tomorrow, yeah? See you." Lia got up from the table, snatched her bag and strode away. I tapped my phone and stopped recording. I sat and thought about that time in Shanghai. We could have dealt with Lia better, and I know that. But you have to understand that she was an excellent opportunity for us. The Enhancers, as we called them, were dangerous. They could do things natural people could not. Lia was a tool for us to expose that. She could also help us find out the truth of their agenda too. That's why we stuck to her. It was important.

After Lia had left Dr Li's clinic, we waited for her back at the hotel and watched. She did not leave her room for four or five days. Then one day, Lia left the hotel. She had got into a taxi and was gone! We thought we had lost her. Susan saved the moment; she had the speed of mind to ask the concierge where Lia had gone. She told him we were her friends and were supposed to meet her, but her phone must be switched off, or didn't work in China. Luckily, the concierge went for Susan's story. He told us that she had gone to a bar he'd recommended. She could be so convincing and friendly. We jumped in a taxi and gave the vehicle our destination.

It was one of those hipster beer bars. Lia told me that she was very much a craft beer fan. She was missing home, so she had gone there on the concierge's recommendation. When we got there, I went into the back room conservatory area left Susan to draw Lia out. We had more luck, apart from the serving staff, we three were the only people in the bar that afternoon. The place was dead. Lia sat next to a roaring fireplace that threw out heat into the room. Susan went over to her. Susan told Lia that her work colleague was in the back, and asked whether she wanted to join us, given how she was alone, and Lia did. I assumed it was because she was somehow desperate for company, but Lia denied that. She said, "No, I was just bored, I'd been in the hotel for, like, days, and Susan seemed a fun person. Friendly." So, Susan led her through. We all sat at the table under the heat lamps. Susa and I told her we were from a large technology company. We were in town trying to win some business. Of course, we said, we couldn't tell her anything about it due to non-disclosure agreements and so on. She was animated and intrigued.

The beer helped too; as she relaxed, we were able to encourage her to confide in us. We also let slip information about our business deal, all hush, hush, of course - and purely invented. Then, as if we all crossed an imaginary line, she told us everything. Lia explained why she was in Shanghai, what she had done, everything. She described her loneliness too, of her inability to connect to people, of having nothing to belong to. Before we knew it, she was sobbing. We consoled her and told her we could help. Lia said, later, "The beer was *much* stronger than it said on the menu, aye. I'd gone through a lot. I'm, like, in China, with a thing attached to my head, alone. Hey, you try not getting gloomy with all that going on. Get drunk, and you'd sob too. Don't judge."

Over the course of the next week, we recruited Lia to our cause. Susan and I gave her a challenge. She was to learn how to better use her new *Gate* by taking it on. I told her, she could help us with our business mission. If she was successful, she could expect a decent payment, to make it worth her while. Susan detailed that we were aware of a company that was developing an integration solution for their main product, the *Gate*. This solution would enable the *Gate* to allow patients a means of sight and hearing, even touch. It was untested, but they were evaluating it in some trial, somewhere. We set Lia to hack into *Bright Futures Cybernetics* and publish their research and the results from this trial online.
