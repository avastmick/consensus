## Lia 2.0

Wellington is a small city. You can walk from one side of the central district to the other in under thirty minutes. My hotel was towards the stadium, at the northern end, and as it was a beautiful day, I decided to walk along the seafront in the sun. People walked, ran, cycled alongside me. To my left, the sea was calm and blue. Cafes and restaurants were full with those enjoying the view across the harbour. It is a beautiful place, dotted with art and boutique shops. The National Museum, *Te Papa* sits at the one end. Young kids, there were diving off a high platform into the water and drawing a crowd. I followed my phone and went up a broad street, away from the sea and vibrant life. 

Lia stood on a corner a couple of blocks up. She was tall, thin, pale and wore a short dress with army-like boots. Her arms were both sleeved with tattoos. "I know somewhere quiet. It has good beer too," she said. We walked along the street and then back towards the sea. We then turned under an archway and down some stairs into a basement bar. It was dark and dingy. The air was stale and smelled of beer and bodies. Small groups of students huddled in corners and nooks. I ordered us a couple of beers that Lia recommended. We took them went and sat in a back room, even dingier than the main bar area. It was quiet, with only a young couple, sat at the other end, tangled in each other's grasp. We sat for a while, not speaking, sipping the beer. "Same again?" she asked. I looked down and saw she had drained hers. "Sure," I said, and she left to get another round. When she returned, smiling slightly.

"Back in the clinic in Shanghai, you know, after the operation, Dr Li kept me there for hours. At first, I just drifted in and out, sleeping and dozing. Then, I was hungry and thirsty. He came in with this sweet tea drink in a gaudy bottle and a brown paper bag with this flat savoury pancake. I guzzled the drink and stuffed the pancake down. I could have had anything, and it would have been good, but it was *exactly* the right thing at that time. 'You good now,' he said. 'Now I show you how to connect. Okay?' 'This connects you to the Internet.' He held up a smooth cylinder and pushed a small button on the side. It flashed a tiny blue light. 'You can pair this to your phone, easy for you I think. Okay?' He then leant me forward and pressed the cylinder into the *Gate*. It clicked in. He gave me my phone, and I searched for a new device. There was only one listed. I clicked 'Connect', and I felt my mind flash for a moment. It was a strange feeling. Not anything too special, but strange. I wasn't sure how I was supposed to feel. 'Relax. I will come back in a while. Your brain will work out what to do. Then you need to learn what to do with that. You will be exhausted.' He left me. He was right I did feel tired. If I closed my eyes, I could see words hanging in the dark, behind my eyelids. I remember drifting off.

"Dr Li came back and woke me. I had no idea of the time, or what was happening. He smiled at me, 'See, I told you it would make you sleepy. I have got you a taxi. You go back to your hotel. Relax and sleep for a week. You will work it out. Once you have managed to get on the Internet, email me. Yes?' I was so dopey and confused, I agreed. He helped me out of the clinic and bundled me into the taxi. It knew where to go. I must have drifted off in the cab; I woke outside the hotel. The concierge was shaking my arm to wake me. I went up to my room and slept for two days. I never saw Dr Li again." She stared at me and drained the last of her beer. "Another? Your round I believe," she said.

The beer was strong. I could feel that slight swirl of mind, so I asked the barman for something not so potent. "This is a good session ale," he said and pointed at a beer tap with a lurid label I couldn't read the name of. I asked for two. He poured them and relieved me of the rest of the NZ Dollars I had. Lia was tapping away on her phone when I got back. "No signal down here, I always forget," she said, sliding the phone into the small fabric bag she had with her. Then, "Thanks," as I handed her the beer. 
    I said to her, "Dr Li is back, by the way. He resurfaced about six months ago. Not sure what happened to him. You should go see him, and finish what you started."

I'm not sure why I said that why I told her. It was true. Li had come back on the scene. Gray had said to me. I wasn't lying when I said I didn't know what had happened to him, exactly. The last I knew was he went off the radar after we'd made the call to the local authorities. I didn't know what happened to him after that.

Lia was quiet for a while. She looked sullen. She swilled the beer back, finishing the pint when I'd only drunk an inch out of mine. "This was rubbish," she waved the beer glass at me. "Weak as. Wanna 'nother?" I shook my head. At that point, I wasn't sure she'd return. She was away a good time. And as I was thinking to check where she'd gone, she returned, another beer in hand. "That ship has sailed," she said as she sat down. I looked puzzled. "Going to see Dr Li. What was that, two years? Anyway, as I understand it, all he'd do is connect to me. The direct connection thing. I've done that. It's no big deal. Well, it is, but once the drama is over, it's the same as. People are still people." 
    "Sorry, Lia, I don't follow you. What do you mean, 'once the drama is over, it's the same?'" I asked.

"Look, connecting to someone is amazing, at first. In fact, it kind of feels like when something has gone wrong, a shock. You know, when your system dumps out adrenalin and thumps it through your body. You feel shaky and awake, hyper-alert and your brain seems to be going much faster than it ever has. And you would, someone else's brain is sending yours vast amounts of data in a format that is native to you. Your mind doesn't need to process anything; there is no need for translation or sorting. It is an instant insertion of feeling, thought and information, all wrapped together. It comes at you in one big hit.

"But, this feeling rushes out so you cannot reach it," she said. "The information shared doesn't stay, it washes in, then out of your mind, like the waves on a beach. That is the natural way of dealing with the vast amounts of data we process each moment. That constant stream that flows into our brains, even without a *Gate*. The images our eyes see; the sounds our ears hear; the smells we breathe; the tastes we ingest; the sensations of touch, of hot or cold, of weight, of wind. A ceaseless deluge floods our brains each second. And remarkably, it makes sense of it all, without conscious thought. It translates it, sorts it, even augments it where it is lacking, and then stores what it thinks it needs. And it drains what it does not.

"But, after a while, you learn how to keep what you need from the connection. That is tiring, God, so tiring. Your body is so drained: like every cell is fatigued. I found the only way I could cope was to turn off the *Gate* connection and sleep. Sometimes, I'd do this for days. I suppose that your brain is rewiring. I don't know.

"But, once all that is over, once the initial wave of sensation subsides, all that is left is a connection with a person. And people are still people, regardless of what the likes of Andrews say. No amount of gadgets will change that. God, they are such a letdown. It's the same as normal life. People, letting you down. In fact, they were worse, 'cause they thought they were like, supermen or something. Yeah, sure, because you've got a great Internet connection makes you better. Please. The idiots." She laughed. She was bitter. 
    "You connected with Rob Andrew and his mob, yes?" Lia stared at me. "You know that, Charles. You sent me there." 
    "Sorry, I didn't know the nature of how you, um, interacted, Lia. I've only recently learned of the whole brain to brain thing. Sorry. , You had a bad experience; it was because *they* were idiots." I wanted to help her.

"*The Crackpots*, that's what I called them, Andrews' lot. After Susan had given me their details, I'd followed them down the rabbit hole. There were five of them. They did the corporate website and Intranet for *Bright Futures*. They were nobodies. I told you guys that, but you thought you knew better. They weren't *Bright Futures*; they were a bunch of web monkeys, not techs involved with the *Gates*. They 't anything special. It's just funny now when you think about it." 
    "Why?" I asked. 
    "Well, you had your guys convinced these guys were the real *Bright Futures*. To you, they were the sinister reality of transhumanism. 'Evil transhumans'," she signalled those words with air-quotes, using two fingers on each hand. She laughed. "Your words, Charles, as I recall. I never got to tell you about them, did I? 

"So, I message them. I tell them I have a *Gate*. I tell them I am into to the whole thing. All that. Before I know it I'm on a flight to San Francisco for an interview. It wasn't an interview, though . It was a sermon. Andrews was telling me, how we were the future. How those without a connection were done for - 'dinosaurs' he called them. Those not like us, without the metal parts, were going to be extinct. He was telling me all this and his cronies, his acolytes, were silent. It was bizarre. We'd sit around like that, listening to him, telling us how it was all going to be: the future. Then in the morning, we'd go to work. It was back to normal. We'd deal with bugs and code releases, and the usual shit that any web developer would do. We'd have team meetings, task lists, code sprints, and so on, you know. Andrews was a pretty good team lead, and dev; he was a decent coder. In fact, he would put in the big hours fixing the crappy code of the rest of the team, who were, to be blunt, awful.

"After a while, I got used to it all. To the weirdness of it all. Hey, I was in San Francisco, had a good job that had fallen in my lap. It was cool. I kind of forgot about you and Susan. I slipped back into my life. Sure, it was crazier than when I was here, but the job was pretty much the same. My evenings were similar, drinking in bars like this," and she indicated the basement bar we were sat in. "Then after work one day, about three months after I'd started, I was talking to Doug, another member of the team. He was okay, I thought, I guess; a terrible developer, though, but worked hard. But, a complete devotee to the *Church of Andrews*. I thought he was cracking onto me, going on about, 'really connecting'. Had I ever done it? Now, listen, I'm a girl working in tech, there's a lot of geeks, so the idea that a man in his, say, late-twenties, would be asking questions that you'd ask in your teens... Well, I thought he thought I was a virgin. So I played along. I said no. It was funny. It seemed to drive him nuts!" She pushed her empty glass towards me. "Your round, Mr Godwin."

"Anyway," she continued, with a full glass before her. "Doug tells Andrews. And he gets all creepy like he's grooming me. Then one evening, he says, 'Lia, we're going to have to pop your cherry.' I went nuts. I told him, that'd had been popped when I was fifteen. Okay, I was rubbing it in a bit, but I was pushing them off, you know. But, they were all like dogs with bones. And they were going on about *connecting*.  I was scared for a bit. I thought they were about to invite me to an orgy or something.  I thought they were talking about *sex*!  

"Then I got it. They were talking about brain-to-brain connection. See, I didn't know about it. *Because of what you did to Dr Li, I'm guessing*. So there you go. Those five guys are the sum of my experience. And after the initial rush, which does something to you, if you get my drift," Lia looks at me from under her brows. "After *that* subsided, I realised what I was left with was a more intense version of Andrews verbal sermons. In fact, I understood why the others were so often silent. Andrews was like a loud radio! He never shut up. He broadcast his ravings all the time. The only way you could get any peace was switching the *Gate* connection off. The funny thing was, he didn't even notice when you did." 
    "Push, pull," I interrupted. 
    "What?" 
    "Something someone I know calls that type of connection, push, pull. One of you pushes and the other pulls. It's not sharing. It's like the Internet; you post something, I read it. And, if you're a big shot like Andrews thought he was, it's one-way. There's nothing that you could share that's of any interest to the likes of him."
    "I get it," she said. "Oh, I get it. No one listens."

Lia was then quiet. She rotated her beer glass back and forth. She stared into the bottom of it, waiting as if it would give her some answer to it all. At that moment I realised, she was little different to Andrews. She was what Gray called a 'wannabe', for whom the idea of being connected was distinct from the reality. It was because they never gave themselves to others. They were trapped within their bubbles, bouncing off others. They never connected to others, regardless of the fancy tech they rammed into their skulls. Don't get me wrong, Lia wasn't a bad person, she was not like Andrews in that sense. Nor was she the narcissist Andrews was either. But, she was a user like him; she was a user of others. She felt entitled; she felt that everyone owed her something, that her failures with people were all due to their lack, not hers. And no amount of technology would fix that.
