# Chapter 20 - Self connection required
<!-- 
This Chapter illustrates those 'left behind':
    - Lia
    - Raphaella
    - Joan
    - Each with their own reason to *not* connect
-->

Lia has done little to address the issues that Gray said she needs to in order to make better use of her connectedness.

Ends that she decides to leave her Gate turned off.
