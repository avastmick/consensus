# consensus failure

Charles Godwin gives an interview. His narcissism completely derails his intended message.

Godwin meets with his group. They attack him. The terror of a hidden hand at work unpicks them, the irony of their own image being projected and then reflected back is heavy here.

The group splinter. Godwin is left berating the others, but they have already left.

Ends with a summary of scathing social media reaction and backlash.
