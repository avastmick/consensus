# Chapter 17

<span class="firstLetter">I</span> AM STILL AMAZED that Joan wanted to meet me. You see, I worked her over more than anyone else. She was an easy target. What I did to her, in public and behind her back, that was unforgivable. I made her out to be the world's worst mother, on television in front of that world. I am not really sure why I did it. I pride myself on not taking the easy option; attacking Joan was the easiest option.
    Of course, as you know, that did not go well for me either. Kicking someone when they are down is not a good look. It looks as brutal as it is. 

You will remember the interview I gave, of course. It was a while ago, though, and to see it again is worth it, to recall the details, see the blows rain down.

> "Good evening, tonight I am joined by Charles Godwin, author, blogger and president of the *Human Association*, a non-profit organisation whose aim is to, I quote, 'Promote and defend the rights of biological humans.' Welcome, Mr Godwin. Could you tell me more about your organisation and what your goals are?"
> 
> "Good evening. Yes, we are a small organisation that came together over five years ago. Our goal is simple: to ensure that normal, everyday people have a voice in the secret struggle that is happening all around us today.  Over the last two decades, large technology companies and wealthy individuals has invested billions of dollars in research in Transhumanism. Their goal is to produce the next generation of human beings. Human two dot zero, if like. These powerful organisations and individuals are not being challenged. They conduct their experiments in secret and work around the various global regulations to bioenhance people either through cybernetic additions or genetic modification. At the *Human Association*, we intend to ensure that these activities are held to account and are included in necessary ethical and moral discussion."
> 
> "I have to say that many of our viewers tonight would be amazed at your statements. They would be asking, 'are there really such things happening?' It sounds rather fanciful, don't you think?"
> 
> "Well, yes it does, I agree. It's hardly something that has a great deal of coverage in the media. And that is our aim: to ensure that this vital conversation is had in public. The future our race has must be decided by all, not just a few hyper-wealthy individuals. Listen, when people make statements like I have, it can sound like the words of a crackpot. It is too easy for the media to dismiss these ideas as being 'out there.' To counter that, I ask the simple question, how much money is involved? As I said, billions, in fact it is tens of billions. It started with the likes of the silicon valley tech giants who all researched into these areas in the past. The founders and leaders of these organisations all invested vast sums of personal money into areas such as gene therapy and neuroprosthetics. Such sums of money, and by such wealthy individuals means this was never a flight of fancy, it's not 'out there', it's all around us. Organisations such as *Bright Futures* have a public corporate goal - to make profit from bioenhancement. While they claim they are a medical research and development corporation they are implicated in frequently operating outside of any regulatory or ethical frameworks."
> 
> "You are referring to their involvement in the case of Sally Taylor, of course."
> 
> "Yes, that and the leaking of their experimental technology into the public domain. People are hooking up to their technology without any regulation or oversight. They are experimenting on live candidates. "
> 
> <!-- GOT TO HERE -->
> 
> "Look the child shouldn't even be alive. By rights, if she were the daughter of a nobody, the sickly offspring, say, of a single-mother from a grotty tower block in South London, she would be dead."
> 
> "So this is a class issue, Charles? I don't follow you."
> 
> "I mean that her mother's privileged position allows this. Follow the money. *Bright Futures* did that. Sally Taylor's mother is your usual rich brat, sponging off the wealth her father's hard work brought. Well educated, but stupid. The sort of self-centred person who thinks they are special and that her off-spring should have greater rights than everyone else."
> 
> "A similar position to yourself, no, Mr Godwin? You are the *off-spring* of wealthy parents; you had an expensive education. Why is this different?"
> 
> "I'm not stupid for one. Or vain enough to put a child through what she has been put through. The poor child is an experiment. Joan Taylor thinks she has has a right to a child, she thinks her child is more precious than any other. Sally has sucked away resources and effort from other children who would have better used it. Her needs have been put above those of others more deserving."
> 
> "Sally Taylor is a sick young girl. Any mother would do as much as possible to save her child, wouldn't they? All children are special in the minds of their mothers; I know mine are. I cannot see that her needs are any higher or lower than any other sick child. She is sick, Mr Godwin, and Mrs Taylor is doing the best she can to save the life of her only child."
> 
> "Other mothers have not had the luxury Joan Taylor has had. They have seen their child die, they had no choice. They did everything they could and it wasn't enough. Mrs Taylor can call on resources others could only dream of."
> 
> "Mr Godwin, if one believes what has been told, the Taylors have not had to pay for any treatment Sally has received. It has been given freely by *Bright Futures*. So, in effect, the treatments provided to Sally would have been available to any other child. They have taken the treatments on offer."
> 
> "When it suits her. She does sometimes and not others."
> 
> "Sorry, I do not follow you."
> 
> "Well sometimes she fights the treatments. She had her own father arrested for treating Sally. This was a woman who refused to vaccinate her daughter. As I said she is self-centred, vain: sometimes the actions of others suit her, sometimes they do not. It is all at a whim."
> 
> "I have to stop you there Mr Godwin. Are you saying, amongst a great deal of other things, that Sally's condition is due to the fact her mother did not vaccinate her? I have not seen any report that her illness was due to anything that could be vaccinated against."
> 
> "Who knows? What I am saying is that it is an example of the actions of a person that is irrational and ill-fit to make life or death decisions. One minute she is refusing her child to be vaccinated, the next she agrees to experimental treatments that reduce further the dignity of her own daughter, other times she is physically wrestling with medical staff in the corridor while they are valiantly trying to save the life of young girl."
> 
> "I have had something just given to me, Mr Godwin. A series of Tweets, in which you state that you agree with not vaccinating children, that, I quote, 'It's the rational thing to do,' and 'It is the only thing a parent can do to fight Big Pharma.' So, now Joan Taylor's actions are irrational and she ill-fit to be a mother. As for the other allegation, I have seen nothing on that. Nonetheless. I'd imagine that all of us would not behave always the way we'd like to, given these circumstances. Really, Mr Godwin, are you going to continue this attack on Sally's mother?"
> 
> "Ah, look, sorry, I didn't want to make this a debate about these things. The fact that Sally was not vaccinated has nothing to do with her being ill. But, it is interesting that she is not. Given the culture we live in, not vaccinating is an experiment. The same logic has led Joan Taylor to experimenting on her own child."
> 
> "I'm sorry, Mr Godwin, this is all complete nonsense. First, you say you support a parent's right to refuse vaccination for their child, the next you say it is that thinking that leads to parents experimenting on their children. Frankly, as a parent, I find that repulsive. You are just throwing out fears, left and right, hoping to make people listen to you. There is a sick young girl; her mother and grandfather are doing whatever they can to keep her alive. Yes some of the things done are unsettling, but the alternative was her death. They had no time to have a national debate first. They made hard decisions that mean Sally is alive today."
> 
> "Is she?"
> 
> "Is she what? Please be clear Mr Godwin."
> 
> "Is she alive? I argue that she can be thought of as alive. She cannot see or hear or speak. She was dead according any measure medical science had. Only a couple of years ago she would have been just a tragic tale of a young life snuffed out too soon. But no, now we cannot face death. If one is rich enough, or well enough connected, one wants to cheat death. That is want Sally is. She is an attempt to cheat death. Poor girl, she is a shell. Her only means of communication is text via a computer. She has no *real* quality of life. She is now more machine than human - she is a cyborg experiment, an abomination! She is the hand puppet of an organisation that operates without morals or ethics. One that uses emotion and tragedy to recruit victims to their cause. And their cause is to replace you and I! They want a new order of humans. Human two-dot-zero. And those at the head of it, like Raphaella DiCosta, would sell the life of a child to advance her own agenda. All around us corporations are taking advantage of us. They used to just steal our money; now they are wanting to steal our future. They want to take our livelihoods with robots, and take our children by making them robots. These people, these technologists, they have no humanity. They have always loved their machines more than their fellow man. Now they just want us to become machines. That is what Sally is - a machine. The girl is dead."
> 
> "Well, that was, um, interesting. Mr Godwin has left us, as you can see. I'm not sure that any of us want to go over what he just said."

I flew from the broadcasting centre. I jumped into a taxi and went straight to the conference room where the board of the *Human Association* were meeting. We were all going to watch the interview and discuss next steps.
    When I got there the room was dark. The only light the large screen. I could see the last moments of the interview playing out. The people in the room looked shell-shocked and slack-jawed. I sat down and the lights in the room brightened. Everyone was looking at me.
    "For God's sake, Charles, were you drunk?" Susan asked, her voice hard. 
    Hopkins sat there, silent. He stared at a point in the centre of the large table, all he could see was his future in pieces, he was looking for an exit, a way to create space between him and this madness. Like he always had. He then stared at me. His face became furious. "Sorry, Charles, I'm with Susan. Have you lost your *fucking* mind? 'The girl is dead'? 'They just want to become machines'? No one will listen to you now, to any of us. Now look, I was with you, I thought I understood where you were coming from, but this is garbage. I'm sorry, I have to show that I don't share your views."
    Susan, jumped in again. "This wasn't what you were after. You said to me you were always after a sensible discussion. This is a long way from sensible. Why didn't you just say what was happening to Sally was sad - and leave it like that! *Bright Futures* was always our target, not Sally Taylor. This is not a conspiracy Charles, this is and was always about making the public know that a company that was operating outside of the law. You didn't even bring that up!"
    I felt I needed to defend myself. "I did say that. Didn't I? I don't know. I just got caught up in the moment."
    "Caught up in the moment!" Susan was shouting now. "Charles, you are an idiot. You think, because you are involved, and at the centre of this thing,  people everywhere will be drawn to it like moths to a light bulb. But they are not. You are a dim light among many. Look about you here, do you think we are just followers? Do you see a vast crowd of acolytes? Wake up! We are noisy, Charles, but we are few. There was some good you could have done, some proper work. But no, you focus on a child." Susan shook her head. She picked up her few things and walked out. 
    Hopkins stared at me across the white table. "Charles, I always had my doubts about you. You're plain nuts. That is exactly what I will be saying to anyone who wants to listen. You're loopy." He gestured a circular shape at his head. As he rose to leave, I felt my anger rise. I exploded.
    "Hopkins, you prick! You had your doubts about me? You never had a original thought in your head. You wouldn't be chairman of *ConnectU Services* without me! I only kept you around so it would irritate Melvin Taylor. You're replaceable and you don't even know it. That's the problem with the likes of you; you think you're smart and ingenious, but you're *average*. The machines will take your kind first!" I remember that I was shouting so loudly and angrily that spittle had dribbled from my lip as I raved. Hopkins was staring at where it fell, grinning. He nodded to the rest of the room and left. He didn't look back.
    Later that week I got a letter informing me that I had been replaced as shareholder representative on the board of *ConnectU Services*. They had taken a vote. It was fast, must have been expensive. The vote to remove me was unanimous. I sold my shares that day. I made a healthy profit. Since Melvin had been removed as chairman, the stock price had gone up. Of course, for the first time in twenty years the actual business was in the red. In order to cut costs Hopkins announced they had sold off their New Zealand concerns. It was the only profitable division. It was bought out by a local consortium.
