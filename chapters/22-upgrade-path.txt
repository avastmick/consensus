# Chapter 22 - Upgrade path

<!-- 
Editing:
    This may be better in a *epilogue*, or similar. 

Storyline:
    This may come after Godwin's story concludes:
    It could mark a genuine rationale for what has happened to Sally - she is truly alive!
Narrative:
    Sally's health takes a final turn for the better. Her gross motor functions, those that enable breathing and pump her blood have returned. She can see again with her eyes.

    She is not a twelve, nearly thirteen year-old girl, however. The is has been radically changed: her body has been ravaged by surgery and altered by, bluntly, experimental treatments. She has physical augmentations from her genetic code to her sight and hearing. Her *Gate* is plumbed to her hypothalamus to enable the storing and uploading of information.

    It is a journey that had had no plan. Each step taken was away from adversity or despair; each turn made was the result of disaster or mishap. There is no blame. There is no conscious decision to make Sally what she becomes. Any discomfort at it, or even horror, comes from within us. She is alive and even thrives. True, she is not a typical girl of thirteen. She is truly special.
