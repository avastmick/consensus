# old days connections

Sally and her mother re-connect. It is beautiful.

But the lack of control Joan has over Sally and all that is happening makes her bitter. She hates the digital means of connecting to Sally, worse though she has lost her immediate role of what she sees is a mother: a guide and instructor, someone who tells the child what she needs to do.

"Put these on," Melvin stands over Joan, holding a large, black pair of goggles.
"What are they?"
"Virtual reality goggles. I want to show you something."
"Really?" Impatient and patronising she sighs as she reaches out from the smooth matt black goggles. "What do I do, just put them on?"
"Yes, just put them on. It will be dark. Push the ear piece into your ear."
Another sigh and slips the goggles over her head. There is nothing to see. She pushes the earpieces into her ears. *This better be good.*
"Hello mum."
"Who's that?"
"It's me, Sally."
"Oh God! You can speak now? My baby!" Tears pooled along the edges of her eyes, causing a sprinkling of tiny lights across her vision.
"I can speak mum. Relax. Are you ready?"
"For what, baby?"
"For me!" Another light at the centre of her vision appeared. She blinked rapidly. Her hand reached out and waved urgently at the outside room.
"What is it? Sally, sweetheart?" The light grew from the point in front of her and started to form a shape. A distant figure was moving towards her. It moved like a mirage, waving in an imagined haze. Then it became solid, a person, a girl. Sally.
Joan ripped the googles from her head. The one ear-piece tugging hard at her ear, stinging.
"What is this dad? God what is this?" The googles fell the floor. Joan's hands covered her face as if in terror at what could be seen. She sobbed; her shoulders moving up and down in sharp spasms of grief.
Grandad stooped to rescue the fallen goggles and quickly swung them up onto his own head. He afixed the ear-pieces.
"Sally? I'm sorry. Your mum got a shock."
"Is she okay?" The little girl stood there, in her favourite blue and grey dress, upon a black plain with no obvious end. Her dark hair was perfectly combed into two neat bunches either side of her head, each held in place with a matching blue bow.
"Sure, she's fine. Just a shock. We should have warned her it would happen. Silly really. Hey that dress is going to getting too small isn't it. That's what you wore at your mum's birthday three years ago!"
"It's mum's favourite. Mine too. I wore last summer, before I was sick." She smiled, an uncertain smile.
"Hey! Look at you with your new smile. I bet that dress was a struggle to get into last summer!" He laughed out loud.
He felt a touch on his arm and removed the googles. Joan was looking up at him, her eyes wet and puffy with her make smudged. "Hang on, Sally."
"I'm sorry." Joan said, "I don't know. Is it really her? I can't see her like this." She sniffed dabbing at her smeary eyes.
"She cannot see you yet. We are working on it. She says she looks at a picture she has for each of us, so I guess it's like Skype when one person has their video turned off. Here, try again." He offered the goggles to her and she took them. Grandad helped her put them on and insert the ear-pieces.
"Hello sweetheart. Sorry, you gave mum such a fright."
"It's okay mum." She laughed.
"You monkey, you think it's funny making your mum scared like that!" She laughed too; they both laughed together for the first time for a long time.
"Do you like my my dress? Grandad said it would be too small now. But I can do anything here!" She stuck her tongue out. "That's to grandad!" and she laughed again.
"The dress looks lovely. You ignore grandad, sometimes he's just rude! I love the way you've done your hair - very cute." Joan felt herself tighten up, she so just wanted to hold her child, pick up the cute little girl before her. She felt her hands go out in a mock cuddle. "Do you know what I am doing?"
"No, what?" Sally grinned.
"I'm giving you a big cuddle." Tears started to flow again and Sally was blurred through the wet of her eyes.
"I'd like that. Grandad's friend says we can work on that. I can see hear and see now."
"I'd love that too. For now we'll just have to imagine."
"Okay."
"You know what?"
"What?"
"Grandad's right. That dress would never do up!"
"Mum!"
"What? You're ten now! Big girl."
