# Chapter 12 - The joy of text is overrated

<!-- Key science and pop-psychology chapter. It has to answer the questions:

1. How is Sally kept alive?
2. Can this be sustained, long-term, or does she recover her physical function (to a degree)?
3. How is sight and hearing restored, in the medium term
4. Is there another stage - does Sally recover sufficient motor function to leave hospital?
5. Is the uplift at the end due to her recovery??

Raphaella DiCosta was not an easy woman to see. I wanted to see her to help me understand why Sally had had further surgery and whether that had helped her mental state. Gray had help arrange the meeting. Even so, I heard nothing for a couple of months. Given how everyone else had opened up I wondered whether Raphaella wanted to. There was still some concern about the company's involvement and how they had pressed Melvin to try out new things for Sally. In the end, *Brighter Futures'* approach was found to be right, I guess. There is no doubt that without their pressure, and Raphaella's in particular, Sally would not be alive today.

Sally's physical health had been hanging from the thinnest of threads for the first four month after her illness struck. Her case was highly unusual; that it was accepted she was alive at all was something that would have been impossible only a decade earlier; that she could survive for so long with her body artificially sustained was, frankly, incredible to medical science, even now. Then when all hope was waning, her heart began to beat without support. She began to stabilise and she returned back within the known boundaries of well understood science.

Still, though, her mind was trapped. There had been physical improvement, true, but there had been no sign of any reconnection of those natural circuits that fed information from the outside world into her brain. The only data that flowed was via a brain computer interface that had been surgically attached inside her skull. The information that came through the *Gate* was largely text-based, either from other people, such as her mother or grandfather, or from the Internet. Gray described it to me as what it must have been like to be online in nineteen-ninety-five. "Mostly text, a few easy to download images, either not much colour or too much colour!" She couldn't take complex images, certainly not those with movement or sound. It wasn't enough. I really think that we underestimate the enormous volume of data we all process. I remember when they were first trialling self-driving vehicles. When I was a boy they had this race in the desert in America somewhere. The vehicles couldn't do it. For years they failed to finish the event. There was just too much going on for the computers at the time to process. Even today, when you take a taxi or a car share, sure they are good now, but they can only do one thing. We can drive a car, have a conversation, think about dinner, plan the day, listen to the radio, enjoy the view, decide where to go after the trip you were on then, decide whether to divorce your husband - you get it. Our brains process all that information coming in through our eyes and ears, most likely we'd not hit anything, all the while doing something else more stimulating. All that in a compact form you could hold in one hand.

I wanted to get into this, to understand it all. I was about to go back to Gray, when I received an email. Raphaella was in town, she could meet the following day. I sent Gray a thank-you and organised a lunch. 

Raphaella was a good looking woman. She was tall, slim and walked with an elegant confidence that drew the eye. She was over fifty, but was popular with men and women half her age. I had never actually met her before. I'd seen her on TV, but I underestimated how she would look in real life. The venue was average, one of those gastropubs that popped up across London. I liked the river, that was why I chose it; that and the fact it was away from the centre of the city; I wanted her to travel a little, so she would treat it less casually. When she walked in, she looked overdressed, but in fact only wore a plain tailored navy suite.

"Charles," she said shaking my hand. She sat and looked at me. "Melvin and Gray have filled me in with what you are doing. Are you seeking redemption?" She sat back and her one shoe pointed at me as it hung in the air from her crossed leg. "No. I am not. I'm not sure I really want that," I said. "I just want to get an insight into the way things were, you know, with Sally." We ordered food. Raphaella also ordered a jug of beer, something that bemused the waiter. "A jug, you must have one. Fill it up with beer. It saves you coming back every five minutes, doesn't it." The poor guy practically ran off, stinging no doubt from the verbal slap she had given him.

"Yes, Sally. We were in a bit of fix at that point. We really thought the Internet would give her what she wanted, but Gray soon told us that she was struggling. You see it wasn't as if she was stuck in a library and she could just go and get a breath of fresh air when she got bored, was it? No, as Gray said, it was more like the mental equivalent of solitary confinement, with only phone calls and books to keep her occupied. She didn't even have the enjoyment of eating, to break up her day. At least we needed to let her out and take a turn or two around the yard, so to speak. We could see that her health was starting to be challenged again. It were as if, without the mental stimuli, her physical well being was adversely affected. She was sad.

"Initially, her physical improvement was remarkable. We could clearly see her mental states externally - whether she was awake or asleep. Once the she had more people to speak to via the Internet everything just became stronger. But it didn't last. After nearly six months she was beginning to be frail, she went down with a couple of infections and had some skin issues - physical problems. Melvin said, said gone back to being snappy and unpleasant when he was talking to her. He's put it down to a phase, you know, a child development phase. But Gray said it wasn't that. They could see she was lonely, bored and just plain sad. It were as if she had nothing really to look forward to.

"Of course, I was in a difficult situation. I had been branded the Devil's Advocate, after an interview I had given on TV. We had underestimated the sentiments people had about what Sally had gone through and *Bright Futures'* part in it. Of course, Charles, you did a great job at making all that mud stick. But the truth is that people *are* uncomfortable with what we are doing and what was being done to Sally. So, all of that didn't make a great place to say that Sally needed more enhancements. In fact, I sat on the idea for a couple of months, to be honest. Sure, we looked into what could be done, but I didn't discuss it with Melvin. 

...

Grandad looked at her hard, "Happy for yourself too, no doubt. She's your ultimate saleswoman. She wants more and more. I'm afraid of where it will go. Her mother is so conflicted."
"I don't understand. What option do you have? You're happy with how she is? You're happy with her just surfing the Internet all day and watching videos of the world about her. She wants interaction. She is smart and has worked it out. If she is stuck physically as she is, she will never be able to live any sort of fulfilled life. She wants more than to be able to message people. She wants to see them directly and that they see her."



Other options with regard to her long-term health and the way she is on life support are evaluated.
