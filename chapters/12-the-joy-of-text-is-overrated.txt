<!-- Key science and pop-psychology chapter. It has to answer the questions:

1. How is Sally kept alive?
2. Can this be sustained, long-term, or does she recover her physical function (to a degree)?
3. How is sight and hearing restored, in the medium term
4. Is there another stage - does Sally recover sufficient motor function to leave hospital?
5. Is the uplift at the end due to her recovery??

Sally's physical health had been hanging from the thinnest of threads since her initial illness. Her case was highly unusual; that it was accepted she was alive at all was something that would have been impossible only a decade earlier; that she could survive for so long with her body artificially sustained was, frankly, incredible to medical science.

Sally is improving rapidly. Her body's health responds to the nourishment her mind is being provided.

"Her improvement is remarkable. We can clearly see her mental states externally now - whether she is awake or asleep or whether she is sleeping. I am so happy for you."
Grandad looked at her hard, "Happy for yourself too, no doubt. She's your ultimate saleswoman. She wants more and more. I'm afraid of where it will go. Her mother is so conflicted."
"I don't understand. What option do you have? You're happy with how she is? You're happy with her just surfing the Internet all day and watching videos of the world about her. She wants interaction. She is smart and has worked it out. If she is stuck physically as she is, she will never be able to live any sort of fulfilled life. She wants more than to be able to message people. She wants to see them directly and that they see her."



Other options with regard to her long-term health and the way she is on life support are evaluated.
