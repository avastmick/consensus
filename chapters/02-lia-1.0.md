# Chapter 2 

<span class="firstLetter">I</span> WENT TO SEE LIA COX. She was my first direct experience of *Enhancement*. She had returned to New Zealand and picked up pretty much where we had first heard of her. She was back working as a software developer in the same multinational services company that was once owned by Melvin Taylor. Her re-hiring may have been a publicity stunt on their part. If so, it was an idea I had earlier considered. See, I have thought, that if events were to have played out differently, Lia might have been the poster girl of our cause. She was a young woman, talented enough and with real prospects to do well in life. She would have illustrated to the world what could go wrong with the transhuman dream, as she had lived its nightmare. I still believe that she has a compelling story to tell, but she is not the centre of it. Her journey did not change her; it only confirmed what she already felt deep inside. And, I have to be blunt, much of her problems were of her making. She gave me insight into some things I didn't know, but nothing too deep.

We were tipped off early last year of someone intent on the procedure - Lia - and that she had flown to Shanghai. It was her boyfriend, or ex-boyfriend, Kyle, who gave her away. He sent a private message to the Twitter account *@H+CONCERNS* that we were running at the time. He was worried about her. He was desperate. We said we'd help find her and give her any assistance we could. In return, he gave us the flight number, a fair few photos, as well as her username on various social media accounts. Lia was a prize. She was the first instance of someone at this stage; others we knew of, had already had the work done. By that point, they were of no use to us. The information on Lia was different. If we could convince her to work with us, she could help create problems for the transhumanists. We could use her to let the local authorities in China know about Dr Li and his involvement, and close down his operation. I flew out that week, with a couple of colleagues at the *Human Association*, Chris Neil and Susan Christien.

We arrived in Shanghai not clear on what we were to do. We had to follow Lia to find Dr Li. We weren't spies, or agents of some hidden conspiracy, as some reports have made us out to be. We were a small group of people that believed in something; we were passionate amateurs. We must have also had luck on our side as we made some stupid mistakes. For instance, we thought we could follow someone from an airport that was distant from the city. When we saw her emerge from the arrivals on time, she didn't go for the taxi exit. Instead, she went for the Maglev. So we followed.  We had no idea how we would have convinced a taxi driver to follow her; we had no viable Chinese between us.

We managed to track Lia from the airport to her hotel. She was very anxious. She was in a foreign country with no grasp of the language or culture. She was going to have a piece of metal inserted into her skull by someone she'd never met. Of course, she was anxious. It made following her easier than we thought it would be too. She stood out. The fact that the streets were not as crowded as we had anticipated aided us also. That said, they had no discernible order. Riders on electric scooters ran, almost silently, in all directions, at speed. Taxis pushed through them all at an even pace. The bikes and scooters moved aside at the last possible moment. Lia walked more in the street than on the pavement. The small shops, selling everything from noodles to scooters to electrical parts, spilt out all over the pavement. Bikes were parked on there; scooters rode along it. It made it hard to get through. Lia jumped from side to side, making herself more visible amongst the organised chaos. We walked along, in almost plain sight.

After a while of following, Lia found a street sign that must have matched the paper she had grasped in her hand. She turned down this street. It too was lined with small shops, this time selling crockery, tea, fruit and haircuts. Music blared out of the hairdressers, two hot looking young girls, wearing bright pink sashes, stood to attention outside. Next to it, opposite a narrow alley, was an office. Its purpose was not apparent. Above the door, 'Twelf', was written, and underneath that, '12'. When I looked up I could see it was an office block, at least 20 stories high. From my position, though I was uncertain if the offices were in use.

Lia went in. She told me, later, "Inside was empty. Opposite the front door was this office desk. On top was this huge old CRT computer monitor with matching beige keyboard and mouse. It was like something from the nineteen-nineties. I was thirty minutes early, so I guessed no one was expecting me yet. It didn't look seedy or anything, but disused, and a bit dusty. In the corner was this other door. When I opened it, I could see it led downstairs. The stairs were well lit and clean, so I went down. It smelt of fresh paint. At the bottom was another door which was half-open. Beyond that a renovated office that was modern, clean and efficient looking. That is where I first met Dr Li." 

Lia told me she was completely surprised by the clinic and its clean efficiency. "In my mind was a vision of a rain-washed, humanity crammed, Asian city, squalid. You know, a back street affair, where the surgery would be done under a naked lightbulb by a grubby man in a blood-stained white t-shirt. It was not like that *at all*, and I had felt relieved, I can tell you. Dr Li had said to me, 'Hey, this is not like Bladerunner, is it?' He had laughed, I remember, his sweet laugh. 'It's okay, everyone thinks because this is China and we are doing sci-fi stuff, this must be like a sci-fi movie! This is Shanghai; it's a modern city.' I reckon he was very proud of his city. He came across as this genuine and likeable man. He calmed me down; I don't know why.

"The operation went fine. This woman had shown up not long after I first got there. She was the anaesthetist. She seemed competent. They prepped me. Dr Li shaved an area on the back of my head where my crown is. They then made me have a shower and put one of those gapey hospital gowns and paper knickers. They then took me into a small, clean room with a trolley bed. I lay down on it. The woman gave me an injection, and I slipped away with Dr Li holding my hand, saying soothing rubbish that I can't remember anymore."

When Lia woke, her head hurt. "A dragging ache, though, not a sharp pain," she told me. "I asked Dr Li if everything had gone well. He said, 'Of course, I've done this many times now.' He then turned and lifted up the hair at the back of his head. There was a *Gate*! Dr Li also had a *Gate*. That made me feel a lot better. To know the person who had drilled a hole in my head and attached something to my brain had also had the same work done was comforting. You know, like getting a tattoo from someone with great tats", Lia said. "Dr Li told me, 'It will ache for a couple of weeks and itch very badly for a month or more. But after a couple of months, you won't notice it. Trust me. You must try to keep it clean. And don't bang it on anything until it has healed. Sleeping will not be easy. So, take it easy for a while.' I remember reaching my hand around. I could feel something there, a cool and smooth metal. It was so neat. I was pretty happy. I spent a few hours there, with Dr Li. He was so friendly. Then when he was happy with everything, that it was all working well, he said I should go back to the hotel and sleep and rest, 'a lot,' he said. I was supposed to go back and see him a week later. But of course, I never did, did I. He was gone by then. Thanks to you, Godwin."

We could have dealt with Lia better. But you have to understand that she was an excellent opportunity for us. The Enhancers, as we called them, were dangerous. They could do things natural people could not. Lia was a tool for us to expose that. She could also help us find out the truth of their agenda too.

We waited for Lia back at the hotel and watched. She did not leave her room for three or four days. Then one day, she left the hotel. She had got into a taxi and was gone! We thought we had lost her. We were saved by Susan, my colleague, having the speed of mind to ask the concierge where Lia went. She told him we were her friends and were supposed to meet her, but her phone must be switched off, or didn't work in China. Luckily, the concierge went for Susan's story. He told us that she had gone to a bar he'd recommended. She could be so convincing and friendly. We jumped in a taxi and gave the vehicle our destination.

It was one of those hipster beer bars. Lia told me that she was very much a craft beer fan. She was missing home, so she had gone there on the concierge's recommendation. When we got there, I went into the back room conservatory area with Chris and left Susan to draw Lia out. We had more luck, apart from the serving staff, we four were the only people in the bar that afternoon. The place was dead. Lia sat next to a roaring fireplace that threw out heat into the room. Susan went over to her. She told Lia that her work colleagues were in the back, and asked whether she wanted to join us, given how she was alone. She did. I assumed it was because Lia was somehow desperate for company, but she denied that. She said, "No, I was just bored, I'd been in the hotel for, like, days, and Susan seemed a fun person. Friendly." So, Susan led her through. We all sat at the table under the heat lamps. We told her we were from a large technology company. We were in town trying to win some business. O course, we said, we couldn't tell her anything about it due to non-disclosure agreements and so on. She was animated and intrigued.

The beer helped too; as she relaxed we were able to encourage her to confide in us. We also let slip information about our business deal, all hush, hush, of course - and purely invented. Then, as if an imaginary line was crossed, she told us everything. She told us why she was in Shanghai, what she had done, everything. She told us too of her loneliness, of her inability to connect to people, of having nothing to belong to. Before we knew it, she was sobbing. We consoled her and told her we could help. Lia told me, later, "The beer was *much* stronger than it said on the menu, aye. I'd gone through a lot. I'm, like, in China, with a thing attached to my head, alone. Hey, you try not getting gloomy with all that going on. Get drunk, and you'd sob too. Don't judge."

Over the course of the next week, we recruited her to our cause. We gave her a challenge. She was to learn how to better use her new *Gate* by taking it on. I told her, 'think of it like a training course, where the output was a working prototype or proof of concept.' She could help us with our business mission. If she was successful, she could expect a decent payment, to make it worth her while. We told her that we were aware of a company that was developing an integration solution for the *Gate*. This would enable the *Gate* to allow a means of sight and hearing, even touch in patients. It was untested, but they were evaluating some trial. We set Lia to hack into *Bright Futures Cybernetics* and publish their research online.
