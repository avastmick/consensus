I have travelled a lot in the last year or so. You see, this story is spread across the globe, from New Zealand to Shanghai, to London to California. It has an epicentre, a focal point, due to the significant person who still lives there. She is the key to it all. She is the embodiment of what the future could be. But she is different, radically so. 

First, I went first to see Lia Cox. She had returned to New Zealand and picked up pretty much where we had first heard of her. She had returned to work as a software developer in the same multinational services company that was previously owned by Melvin Taylor. I have thought, that if events were to have played out differently, she may have been the poster girl to our cause: a young woman, talented enough and with real prospects to do well in life. She would have illustrated to the world what could go wrong with the transhuman dream, as she had lived it as a nightmare. I still believe that she has a compelling story to tell, but she is not the centre of it, rather than a nightmare, hers was just restless sleep. I have to be blunt, much of her problems are of her making. Still, she gave me insight into some things I didn't know.

We were tipped off early last year of someone intent on the procedure - Lia - and that she had flown to Shanghai. It was her boyfriend, or ex-boyfriend I guess now, Kyle, that gave her away. He sent a private message the Twitter account @H+concerns that we were running at the time. He was worried about her; actually he was desperate. We said we'd help find her and give her any assistance we could, in return we were given the flight number, a fair few photos, as well as her usernames on social media accounts. This was our first instance of finding someone at this stage. The others had already had the work done. Often they were of no use to us. The information on Lia was different. She meant two things to us: one, that we had an opportunity to convince someone to work with us, someone who could help create problems for the transhumanists; and two, let the local authorities in China know about Dr Li and his involvement, and hopefully close down his operation. I flew out the same week, with a couple of more technical colleagues, Chris Neil and Susan Christien.

We were in Shanghai. We had to follow Lia to find Dr Li. We weren't spies, or agents of some hidden conspiracy as some reports have made us out to be; we were a small group of people that really believed in something; we were passionate amateurs. We must have also had luck on our side as we made some stupid mistakes. Like thinking we could follow someone from an airport that was distant from the city and trying to get a taxi driver to understand when we had no useful Chinese to communicate with. We saw her emerge from the arrivals on time. She didn't go for the taxi exit. Instead she went for the Maglev. So we followed. Chris made a joke about public transport being much easier for spies than other forms of transport.

Luckily, we managed to track Lia from the airport to her hotel. She was obviously very anxious, as you'd imagine. She was in a foreign country with no grasp of the language or culture; she was going to have a piece of metal surgically inserted into her skull by someone she'd never met. Following her was easier than we thought it would be, she seemed lost, wandering the streets of Shanghai. We were aided by the fact that the streets were not as busy as I had expected, and that they had no obvious order. Riders on electric scooters ran, almost silently, in all directions, at speed. Taxis pushed through them all at an even pace, the bikes and scooters moving aside at the last possible moment. Lia walked more in the street than on the pavement; the small shops, selling everything from noodles to scooters to electrical parts, were all over the pavement. Bikes were parked on the pavement; scooters rode along it. But oddly, everything worked without drama, like those dances you can see in the evenings in the parks and side streets there, anyone can join but everyone knows the moves. We walked along, in almost plain sight, while Lia jumped from side to side, making herself unintentionally visible, making our job much easier.

After a while, Lia had found a street sign that matched the paper she had grasped in her hand. This street was similarly lined with small shops, this time selling crockery, tea, fruit and haircuts; music blared out of the hairdressers, two hot looking young girls wearing bright pink sashes, stood to attention outside. Next to it, opposite a narrow alley, was an office with no obvious indication, to me anyway, of which business it was an office for. Above the door, 'Twelf', was written, and underneath, '12'. When I looked up I could see it was an office block, maybe 20 stories high. From my position, though I was uncertain if the offices were in use.

She went in. She told me, later, "inside was empty. Opposite the front door was this office desk on which sat this huge old CRT computer monitor with matching beige keyboard and mouse. It was like something from the nineteen-nineties. I was thirty minutes early so I guessed no one was expected me yet. It didn't look seedy or anything, just disused. In the corner was this other door. When she I it, I could see it led downstairs. The stairs were well lit and clean so I went down. At the bottom was another door which was half-open, beyond a modern, newly renovated office that was clean and efficient looking. This is where I first met Dr Li." 

Lia told me she was completely surprised by the clinic and its clean efficiency. "In my mind was a vision of a rain-washed, humanity crammed, Asian city, squalid. You know, a back street affair, where the surgery would be done under a naked light-bulb by a grubby man in a blood-stained white t-shirt. Whereas, it was not like that *at all*, and I had felt really relieved, I can tell you. Dr Li had said to me, 'Hey, this is not like Bladerunner, is it?' He had laughed, I remember, this nice laugh, and said, 'it's okay, everyone thinks because this is China and we are doing sci-fi stuff, this must be like a sci-fi movie! This is Shanghai, it's a modern city.' I reckon he was very proud of his city. He just came across as this really genuine and likeable man. He made me feel really calm, I don't know why.

"So, the operation went fine. This woman had showed up not long after I had met Dr Li. She was the anaesthetist. Again she seemed really competent. They prepped me. Dr Li shaved an area on the back of my head where her crown was. They then made me have a shower and put one of those gapey hospital gowns and paper knickers. They then took me into a small, clean room with a trolley-bed. I lay down on it. The woman gave me an injection and I slipped away with Dr Li holding my hand, saying soothing rubbish that I can't remember any more."

When Lia woke, her head hurt. "A dragging, ache though, not a sharp pain," she told me. "I asked Dr Li if everything had gone well. He told me, 'Of course, I've done this many times now.' He then turned and lifted up the hair at the back of his head. There was a *Gate*! Dr Li also had a *Gate*. This made me feel a lot better, to know the person who had just drilled a hole in my head and attached something to my brain had also had the same work done was comforting. You know, like getting a tattoo from someone with great tats", she said. "Dr Li told me, 'It will ache for a couple of weeks and itch very badly for a month or more. But after a couple of months you won't notice it. Trust me. You must try to keep it clean though and don't bang it on anything. Sleeping will not be easy. So just take it easy for a while.' I was pretty happy. I spent hours there, with Dr Li. He was so friendly. He connected with me. *Amazing*. Then when he was happy with everything, that it was all working well, he said I should go back to the hotel and sleep and rest, 'a lot,' he said. I was supposed to go back and see him a week later. But of course, I never did, did I. He was gone by then. Thanks to you."

Yes, we could have dealt with Lia better. But you have to understand that she was an excellent opportunity for us. The Enhancers, as we called them, were dangerous we felt, they could do things natural people could not. Lia was a tool for us to expose that. That and what their agenda really was.

We waited for Lia back at the hotel. She did not leave her room for three or four days. The one day she left the hotel. She had got into a taxi! We thought we'd lost her. We were saved by Susan, my colleague, having the speed of mind to ask the concierge where Lia went. She told him we were her friends and were supposed to meet her, but her phone must be switched off, or possibly didn't work in China. Luckily, the concierge went for Susan's story. He told us that she had gone to a bar he'd recommended. We jumped in a taxi and gave the vehicle our destination.

It was one of those hipster beer bars. Lia told me that she was very much a craft beer fan and was missing home, so she had gone there on the concierge's recommendation. When we got there, I went into the back room conservatory area with Chris and left Susan to draw Lia out. Again we had some luck, apart from the serving staff, we four were the only people in the bar that afternoon. Susan went over to Lia who was next to a fireplace that was stacked with wood, but unlit. She told Lia that her work colleagues were in the back, and asked whether she wanted to join us, given how she was alone. She did. I assumed it was because Lia was somehow desperate for company, but she denied that. She said, "No, I was just bored and Susan seemed a fun person." So, Susan led her through. We all sat at the table under the heat lamp. We told her we were from a large technology company, in town trying to win some business; of course, we said, we couldn't tell her anything about it due to non-disclosure agreements and so on. She was animated and intrigued.

The beer helped too; as she relaxed we were able to encourage her to confide in us. We also let slip information about our business deal, all hush, hush, of course. Then, as if an imaginary line was crossed, she told us everything - why she was in Shanghai, what she had had done, everything. She told us too of her loneliness, of the her inability to connect to people, in having nothing to belong to. Before we knew it she was sobbing. We consoled her and told her we could help. Lia told me, later, "I think the beer was *much* stronger than it said on the menu. I'd gone through a lot. In China, with a thing attached to my head, alone. Hey, you try not getting gloomy with all that going on. Get drunk, you'd sob too. Don't judge."

Over the course of the next week, we recruited her to our cause. She was to learn how to better use her new *Gate* by taking on a challenge. I told her, 'think of it like a training course, where the output was a working prototype, or proof of concept.' She could help us with our business mission and if successful could expect a decent payment, to make it worth her while. We told her that we were aware of a company that was developing an integration solution for the *Gate* that would enable it to allow better means of sensing sight and hearing, even touch. We set Lia to hack into Bright Futures Cybernetics and publish their research online.
