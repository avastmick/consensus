# we are connected

I had the fish masala knocked up in no time. It was a dish I enjoyed cooking, as well as eating. I cooked some basmati rice the rice cooker and I rolled out some dough I had mixed and cooked plain chapattis on a hot frying pan. While I was busy cooking, Gray was lounging back on the sofa with a bottle of beer in her hand. Somehow, I could tell she was not alone. "Shall we eat, Gray?" I loaded the table up with food. I was pretty happy with it. "Is it good?" I asked, almost as soon as I had dished up. "Hey, give me a chance, Charles, it looks good though, I wouldn't have thought." She scooped up a piece of fish with her bread. "Hmm, hmm, yep, that's good." She ate quickly and neatly. We didn't say much. I was pleased the food had gone down well. She sat back and sipped from her beer bottle. "Let's go and relax. This can wait." I gestured at the dishes on the table. I grabbed a couple of beers from the fridge and flopped down on the sofa alongside Gray. "Let's continue then," she said, keen to finish her story. I settled back and relaxed. 

"All of a sudden, the five of us there had a purpose. We'd made the situation fun. Of course, *Bright Futures* was initially a bit pissed at the whole Internet connection to the brain thing. We were messing with their experiment; all their carefully controlled data was now frankly useless. But, after some time, they came round, maybe they were bored too. They looked at the cables, and worked with Alan and Simon on the firmware. It was all going pretty well and we were buzzing on the possibilities that came from having this chunk of metal glued to our brains. We spent our time, improving our on-line skills, or just coming up with ideas. Brandon, the other member of our little gang, floated the idea of us directly connecting. Until that point we had become pretty good at surfing the Internet, but I suppose, we weren't really any different in the way we used it from anyone else, just faster. Brandon thought if we could push the raw data through a connection, without it being translated to IP, we could get more through it. Brain to brain so to speak." 

Gray laughed, as if she were sharing a private joke with me. "It's pretty basic computer science really," she continued. "One system interfaces to another generally through an agreed means of translation. This is fine, but limits the scope of what can be shared. Add new types of data in one system and you may not be able to share it with another, not without first changing the translation layer. So, change becomes expensive and then change doesn't happen. Now, if we could know that both systems were identical, with the same processes and architecture, we could lose the translation layer entirely. The data could be raw and not narrowed down by rigid translation structures. Surely, one brain could interpret data from another brain, if you can get that data into it.

"Then, one morning, one of the *Bright Futures* techs came to see us. She was all excited, in one hand she held one the cables we were using to get on-line. In the other a flat round lump of metal, about the size of a hockey puck, about three inches across. 'Who wants to try this bad boy?' She said to us grinning. 'So, you can have this,' and she held up the orange cable we were so used to dragging around, with its box and the metal snap-clip we used, to clip to our shoulder and prevent us ripping the Gate out of our skulls when we did inevitably tangle ourselves. She let the cable ends hang onto the floor. 'Or this,' and holds up the puck. The technician, Siobhan, had managed to make the cable wireless and connect to a wireless data connection. 'So, you want to carry on like tethered cows, or be mobile?' We were so goddam excited, we were like kids in a toy store.

"Sam volunteered, of course. Siobhan removed an inner part of her *Gate*, the data socket and screwed in the *Puck*, as we called it. She pressed a button, and a tiny light came on. 'Listen, there's a 100Wh battery in there. If you thrash it, both the battery and the video card inside will heat up. So you'll basically cook your brain. Have fun, people!' A huge grin spread across Sam's face. She span around, laughing. Each of our phones pinged as messages hit them. ``Look, no hands, no cable. It's magic, mom!`` the messages read. Sam was on-line. She could go anywhere now and be connected. She then said, 'Jesus it's heavy though. I'll end up with neck muscles like Gray, carrying this around all day. Good work Siobhan, but needs work. I bet we don't need that fancy high density battery, for a start.'

"So, we had a means to connect, without trailing a big-ass cable behind us. Siobhan, Alan and Simon worked on 'Puck' designs, and we each took turns in trying out the new, improved models. Within a couple of weeks, we'd got the size and weight down so even a pencil-necked chick Like Sam could wear it for hours without discomfort. The battery would last all day and we would only take it out at night to sleep. Of course, in the next couple of years they have shrunk even more. See?" Gray turned her head from me and pulled free the stubby ponytail. She parted the hair and there was the *Gate*, a smooth, grey metal ring that rose less than quarter of an inch from her scalp. Protruding another eighth of an inch, maybe less, was a smooth domed insert: the wireless connector. It was really very neat and unobtrusive. Gray pushed in the dome and turned it. It popped out and she pulled it from the *Gate*. It was about the size of the tip of her index finger. It was smooth and slippery, with no obvious markings. "Imagine, this, but the size of a ice hockey puck. Those early ones really did suck. I can even sleep with this in. And the battery lasts most of the week - similar to your mobile phone."

I was fascinated. "May I have a look at your *Gate*, Gray?" She turned so I could see it better. It was so neat. "Given it goes all the way into your brain, how do you keep it clean? Why doesn't it get infected or sore?" Gray turned to look at me and pushed the connector back in with a audible click. "The prosthetic, the *Gate*, works just like the way they attach new artificial limbs to people. The titanium alloy body attaches directly to the bone. Over it is a metal matrix that is porous so the soft tissue and the skin actually grows into it. This creates a natural living seal, so no bugs or alike can get in. It is similar to how deer antlers work: below the skin the metal is porous, above it super smooth. As clever as all that is, you still need to take some care, of course, but it's pretty robust tech." It was impressive and not at all like the kind of thing that you'd have seen in sci-fi movies - horrific looking lumps of metal that burst angrily from sore and swollen skin. No this looked jewel-like in comparison. Once again my hard held prejudices were challenged by what I saw. "Sorry, Gray, please continue," I said.

"Anyway, as you can imagine, it didn't take long for us all to start thinking about Brandon's direct connection idea. The inconvenience of the cables meant that we hadn't really thought about it too much again. To do so would need some kind of router between us. It would be ridiculous, with even more tripping and tangling ourselves up. But now we could interface directly; the routing could be done wirelessly. Sam, as always, was keen to give it a go. So, she and Simon connected. It was much easier than we had thought it would be. With a couple of firmware tweaks Alan had made, they were interfacing without any significant translation. The look on their faces. I swear it hit Sam right in her lacy panties, the rush! Their eyes were dilated, they were breathing hard, they were starting to sweat! It was funny really. Until you actually connect with someone else like this, it is very difficult to describe it. Some say it is like taking drugs, some like sex, but it's not like any of these. At all. I think it is more like, you know, how those religious crazies feel when the *Spirit* takes them. Trust me, all you life you want to be close to people. We are designed that way, as social animals. But we always carry fear with us: fear of rejection; fear of misunderstanding; fear of suffering. All that goes away with this," and Gray tapped the back of her head. "For the first time in my life I was close to people with no fear, no confusion of what they mean, no misunderstanding of what they want and need."

Gray stopped. She sat there for a moment and then looks at me. "I wish I could convince you to try it, I really could. I know you wouldn't, though."

I brushed off the temptation and walked over to the refrigerator for two more beers. I let the cool air ease the skin of my face. I breathed deeply, calming myself. "Can you really read each other's minds?" I asked as I handed her a beer.

"No. Well, sort of, again, this is difficult to explain. The person you are connected to is open to you. You can feel them, feel their emotions as well as what they want to share with you. It's a lot of information and I guess you need to focus on. Sorry, this may not be making mush sense. Try not to think of what we all do in our heads, as just talking, but inside our heads. If you think hard about it, that's not what we are doing most of the time. Sometimes we do, say, when we are narrating what we are thinking - it is like we a commentator at a sports game, we are explaining what is going on. What is actually going on is not speech. It is only *ordered* by our internal speech, kind of like we are preparing to share it, externally. So we can read, or rather hear, this commentary; but the underlying events are closed to us. At least right now. Does that make sense?" I nodded back at her, then rotated my levelled hand from side to side, "sort of," I said, echoing her own words.





Connected increases my sapience not my sentience. Look it up.


How connected consensus works. The analogy of the pull request, but in real-time and fast. The connection of feelings not just language.

Ends with consensus is reached. They will.

 reputation

The connected group feel that while they want to help Kia, she has to help them too. This is the new world: you must enhance your reputation, to do this you must participate. Think of this like a tutorial leading you through a set of steps to gain badges for online interactions. It is a led activity, but one you need to do in order to gain access to higher levels. You need to show competency.

This time, due to the circumstances there is a time-limit for Kia. A clock starts to tick that will mean that she will be excluded from the very thing that she has always wanted - a family to belong to.

To do this she needs to challenge her own interaction with the world. To become more honest with herself and Not have such high expectations of others.

It starts well enough, but as the levels get harder and harder she finds herself falling back into old patterns. She starts to resent the challenge and starts to resent the Gate as the answer.

Ends with Lia
