# bad old days

Is is about 10 o'clock in the morning when Joan knocks on the door. There was no answer from the downstairs intercom. She knows her mother rarely goes out, so either the intercom is not working or she is drunk and asleep. A old woman with tightly permed, almost orange, hair had come out of the lobby door and Joan had gone in and up in the lift.

It takes nearly five minutes for Vi to come to the door. Joan had banged urgently on the door and yelled in a hushed tone through the letterbox. "Mum, let me in." She felt the hotness of her skin as she had thought of the people in the apartment block listening to her try to rouse her mother.

The door opens. "Joan! This is a lovely surprise. Sorry I was in the shower and couldn't have heard you." Vi stands there in her lurid pink and yellow dressing-gown that gaped awkwardly. Her skin and hair perfectly dry. She is heavily made up, but it is smudgy and poorly applied. "Come in, come in. Do you want a drink?"
"Tea. Do you have any milk?"
"Of course, I think. Let me check." Vi hustles down the corridor into the kitchen at the end of the hallway. "No, love. Sorry. How about coffee then?"
"Okay." Joan walks into the living room, not following her mother. The room is messy, with magazines and free papers on the floor. It is arranged as if the furniture had slid from side to side, like on a boat in a swelling sea, and settled at a point once the motion had stopped. A low coffee table lies close to a lounge chair, on it is a cushion with a bright knitted cover lined up with the chair. Across the table were drinks glasses and an overflowing ashtray. Opposite this a huge television that dominated the room.
Vi walks in with two large mugs of black coffee. She offers Joan one, hesitates then offers her the other.
"Thanks." Joan takes the mug and sits on the edge of the sofa that is at an awkward angle to everything else in the room.
"You're welcome. So good to see you. Do you like my new TV? Melvin bought it, I believe. Turned up one day. I told the delivery man to take it away, horrible thing. So vulgar! But he insisted and so here it is. How is your father?"
"He's good. He's happy that we've managed to reach Sally and we can now communicate with her."
"Does he know you've come to see me?"
"It's none of his business who I see, mum."
"So you're not happy then. You only come to see me if you're unhappy. When you're happy and things are good, I never see you from one month to the next." Vi sips from her coffee cup and looks over it at Joan who is looking down at the thick carpet that needs a clean.
"So," Vi smiles, "you're not happy at the situation you've got yourself in, are you sweetheart."
"What situation, mum?" Joan's voices is soft and quiet.
"Sally of course. You let them do that to her. How could you? You know it's wrong, poor baby. You've seen what they have been saying on the TV. I was talking to Mrs Hawkins downstairs - funny lady, younger than me if you can believe it. Well, she has her granddaughter around all the time, like I used to. I couldn't now could I, not now Sally is, well, you know."
Joan reached across and put her cup down on the coffee table. Vi placed her hand on Joan's arm and says, "It's not right, Joan. It's not natural. I mourned her when she died and now I hear she's back on a computer. They say so on TV. It's more than I can take." Vi takes a gulp from the coffee cup and looks at the TV accusingly.
"She didn't die, mum, for Christ's sake! She's alive. She's just, well," her voice trailing away as she pinches her lips together, her eyes wet.
"I had a gentleman caller, Joan! I forgot to say."
"Nobody says that, mum, 'a gentleman caller'. You sound like you're living in nineteen-fifty."
"More's the pity we're not. Those were better days, I can tell you," Vi says as she swills the rest of the coffee cup's contents into her thin mouth.
"Hmmm, because you were a small child then." Joan looks about the room, her arm following her gaze. "Not much has changed really though I guess, just no one about to pick up after you."
Vi's face hardens. "Don't come the smart-arse with me, girl. You come here and laugh at me? You're disgusting, what you've done. Charles agrees with me. What a lovely man, the kind that would sort you out and your 'daddy' issues. He said..."
"Who's Charles?"
"Charles Godwin, you must have seen him on TV."
"I haven't been watching much TV mum, I've been busy, if you didn't notice."
"I wouldn't know, sweetheart. I only know what is going on from the TV. No one tells me anything. Anyway he said that people were doing unnatural things. This was against nature, against God."
Joan laughs a tight and bitter laugh. "God, really? Since when did you start believing in God?"
"There's lots of things you don't know about me," Vi snaps. "You think you know everything. But you don't. If you did you wouldn't have done that to my granddaughter. Charles said that you've been tricked. There is this organisation, Brighter Future they're called, who are trying to make new humans. An army of zombie-like people to take over the world. They have done this to Sally."
"What are you talking about? Fucking zombies - mum really?"
"It's true, I tell you. Charles and some other people are trying to stop them before it's too late. If they don't, one day we'll all wake up and these people will be in charge - it's like Nazi Germany, these people are trying to make a master race." Vi stopped. "How do you feel about Sally? Are you happy with how she is? You can't be. I'm not. It's horrible. That's not living. It's a computer game. Like those ones that kids spend all their time playing, rather than going outside and meeting real people. What sort of life is she going to have? None." Vi is on a roll, now. Her monologue seems not really meant for Joan, who is sinking into her seat as if crushed by the onslaught of thoughtless words. "What happens when she is a teenager, that's not long away? She meets noone her age. She can't, can she? She's a zombie. They can do some cruel things nowadays, in the name of medical science. Progress they call it. I call it abomination! Poor girl, she has become a circus freak. People are using her and you're letting them. I wasn't much of a mother, but I'd never have allowed that."

Joan stands up, her head swimming so she has to lean down to steady herself with a hand. Vi leans her hand down to the side of her chair and picks up another mug. She drinks from it, staring at the television. "I'm off, mother. I'll let my self out." She moves out of the room and towards the front the door.
"Do that," Vi says. She takes another gulp from the new cup and picks up the TV remote.
Joan walks out of the apartment, the sound of the too loud TV is silenced with the slam of the door.
