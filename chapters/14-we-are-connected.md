# we are connected

I had a nice fish masala knocked up in no time. A rice cooker helped with the rice - I can't see why anyone would not own one. I then rolled out some dough I had mixed together earlier and cooked the chapattis on a hot frying pan. Gray was lounging back on the sofa with a bottle of beer in her hand. Somehow, I could tell she was not alone. "Let's eat, Gray." I loaded the table up with stuff I'd cooked. I was pretty happy with it. "Is it good?" I asked. "Hey give me a chance, Charles, it looks good though, I wouldn't have thought." She scooped up a piece of fish with her bread. "Hmmm, mmmh, yep, that's good." She ate quickly and neatly. We didn't say much. I was pleased the food had gone down well. She sat back and sipped from her beer bottle. "Let's go and relax. This can wait." I gestured at the dishes on the table. I grabbed another couple of beers from the fridge and flopped down on he sofa with Gray.

"So, let's continue then. As I said, there were five of us. Bright Futures was initially a bit pissed at the whole Internet connection to the brain thing. They were hardcore science nuts, we were messing with their experiment. But, they came round after a bit. They looked at the cables and worked with Alan and Simon on the firmware. Then Brandon, the other member of our little gang, floated the idea of us directly connecting. Until that point we were pretty good on the Internet, but we weren't really any different in the way we used it from anyone else, just faster. Brandon thought if we could push the raw data through a connection, without it being translated to IP, we could get more through it. Brain to brain so to speak." Gray laughed at that, as if sharing a private joke. "It's pretty basic computer science really,' she continued. "One system interfaces to another generally through an agreed means of translation. This is fine, but limits the scope of what can be shared. Add new types of data in one system and you may not be able to share it with another, without first changing the translation layer. So, change is expensive. Now if we could know that both systems are identical, with the same processes and architecture, we could lose the translation layer entirely. The data could be raw and not narrowed down by rigid structures. Surely, one brain could interpret data from another brain, if you can get that data into it.

"Meanwhile, one of the Bright Futures techs comes to see us. She was all excited, in one had she held one the cables we were using to get online. In the other a flat round lump of metal, about the size of a hockey puck, about three inches across. 'Who wants to try this bad boy?' He says to us. 'You can have this,' and hold up the trailing orange cable, with its box and letting the cable ends hang onto the floor. 'Or this,' and holds up the puck. The technician, Siobhan, had managed to make the cable wireless and connect to a 5G connection. Sam volunteered. Siobhan removed an inner part of the Gate, the data socket and screwed in the Puck, as we called it. She pressed a button, and a tiny light came on. 'Listen, there's a 100Wh battery in there. If you thrash it, both the battery and the video card will heat up. So you'll basically cook your brain. Have fun.' A huge grin spread across Sam's face. She span around, laughing. Each of our phones pinged as messages hit them. 'Look, no hands, no cable. It's magic ma!' the messages read. Sam was online. She could go anywhere now and be connected. She then said, 'Jesus it's heavy though. I'll end up with neck muscles like Gray, carrying this around all day. Good work Siobhan, but needs work. I bet we don't need the fancy high density battery for a start.'

"So, we had a means to connect, without trailing a big-ass cable behind us. Siobhan, Alan and Simon worked on a new 'Puck', we each took turns in trying out new, improved models.


It didn't take long for us all to start thinking about connecting to each other. The inconvenience of the cables meant that we hadn't really thought about it too much. To do so would need some kind of router between us. It would be ridiculous. But now we could interface directly.

Siobhan, as always, was keen to give it a go. So she and Simon connected. It was easy. With a couple of firmware tweaks Alan had made, they were interfacing without any significant translation. The look on their faces. I swear it hit Siobhan right in her panties, the rush. Their eyes were dilated, they were breathing hard, they were starting to sweat! 

Until you actually connect with someone else, it is very difficult to describe it. Some say it is like taking a drug, some like sex, but it's not like any of these. At all.







Connected increases my sapience not my sentience. Look it up.


How connected consensus works. The analogy of the pull request, but in real-time and fast. The connection of feelings not just language.

Ends with consensus is reached. They will.

 reputation

The connected group feel that while they want to help Kia, she has to help them too. This is the new world: you must enhance your reputation, to do this you must participate. Think of this like a tutorial leading you through a set of steps to gain badges for online interactions. It is a led activity, but one you need to do in order to gain access to higher levels. You need to show competency.

This time, due to the circumstances there is a time-limit for Kia. A clock starts to tick that will mean that she will be excluded from the very thing that she has always wanted - a family to belong to.

To do this she needs to challenge her own interaction with the world. To become more honest with herself and Not have such high expectations of others.

It starts well enough, but as the levels get harder and harder she finds herself falling back into old patterns. She starts to resent the challenge and starts to resent the Gate as the answer.

Ends with Lia
