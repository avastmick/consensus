# Suicide note

Dad,

I am so sorry about this. I really am. I know you have tried to help me and be the father you felt I needed. Please don't hate me for what I've done. I didn't do it to be spiteful, to you or anyone.

I no longer feel there is a place for me in this world. Nothing I do seems to come out well. I have tried so hard to make things work.



I love you Dad.

Joan.
