The hush of the hospital room followed us, back to Melvin's house. He made sandwiches and we ate them silently in the kitchen. We sat at a bare wooden table on old chairs. Something in me felt shame as the physical enjoyment eating gave me. The usual calm that I felt when with Melvin was absent. He was tense.

"Do you remember the day we first me, Charles?" I did. I remembered Melvin walking into the boardroom of the Great Portland Street office of *ConnectU Services*. Funny, even though I was sat opposite him only two years later, my memory of him that day was of a taller, younger, more vigorous man. That man was busy and irritated at the invitation to that meeting. "I do remember, Melvin, I remember you being particularly busy." "I was. The world had gone to hell and I had been called in by the board. I knew something was up."

The offices used to be those of a television company, when that was a thing, when people used to sit in front of their TVs and watch what they were told. I'd imagine the building was pretty flash, back in the day. Now, it was badly in need of renovation and looked worn and tatty. Because of that, it was cheap office space, for its size and location. Ideal for a IT services company that was obsessed with tight margins. Of course, I knew all this as I was a significant share holder in *ConnectU Services*. That was the reason I was at the meeting, as a shareholder representative. You see, there is so much luck in this story. It seems all designed, but it was mostly just chance.

"Even though I knew that something was up," Melvin then said. "I was blind sided by what they said. It was all so personal. And of course, anybody who mentioned Sally was going to light my fuse at that time. Add to that, it was Grant Hoskins who called the meeting. I thought he was a prick. A bean counter, who didn't have an ounce of business acumen, who'd worked himself up onto the board. I never liked him. Was he your friend, Charles?" I laughed. I didn't like Grant either. He was one of those empty ambitious types, I felt. Those ones who gained promotion and position by just outlasting everyone else, not because they had any significant talent. He reminded me of Conrad's station manager in *Heart of Darkness* who only had reached that position because he had a bulletproof constitution and thrived while everyone else's health failed them. Grant Hoskins' was as equally petty and jealous towards those with any talent. Melvin's animosity towards him was mutual. He was a key ally, but I loathed him. "No, he was not my friend, Melvin." I said. "He was just useful. To be honest with you, I couldn't stand the man. I hated the way he was so smug every time he thought he had the upper hand." Melvin nodded at me. 

"'Come in Melvin, please have a seat,'" he mimicked Hoskins' petty tone. "' We won't take up much of your valuable time. I'm sure you have lots on you plate right now, what with the media interest, and everything.'" Melvin's impression was good. That was the issue. There *was* concern that the media attention that *ConnectU Services* had at that time was not good for business. It was shown in the stock price. Melvin had, for some years now, been little more than a figurehead. The company was run by the likes of Hoskins now. The hacking incident was a huge embarrassment and Hoskins saw to it that Melvin's involvement with *Bright Futures* was to blame, not his inept leadership. The company's security policy came clearly under his accountability. But he had, successfully, argued that the breach was targeted at *ConnectU Services* due to Melvin alone.

"What I hated about that session was the logic was wrong. Hoskins was covering up his own ineptitude by throwing dirt my way. You remember it, 'Don't you think, Melvin, that the attention you are receiving because of Sally is not in line with what is best for *ConnectU Services*,'" Melvin again took on the tones of Hoskins. "Why would Sally make *ConnectU Services* a target? Especially as the hackers were pro-Transhuman and indirect employees of *Bright Futures*. The man was an idiot. But the logic was all wrong. Of course, I didn't know then, that you were behind it. It all made sense once I knew your agenda, Charles." Melvin shook his head. "Did you believe what you said? Do you believe it that stuff now? Or was it just an angle, something to get people all emotional and misdirected from any sensible discussion?" He had me then. I wasn't sure. See, like I said before, a lot of this was just luck. I suppose, my talent is riding luck when it is going my way. Looking back then, with these questions and the ramifications of any answers I could give, I wasn't sure what to say. "I don't know, Melvin," was all I could come up with. "You don't know! What do you mean, you don't know?" "I mean, that like lots of things that happen, I wasn't fully in control." "But what you asked me, about Sally, 'Do you think Sally is still alive, or rather, do you think she is still the same girl, is she still you granddaughter?' You said that. That's pretty direct. You saw her as an abomination." We fell silent. The hard wooden chairs were uncomfortable. I wanted to leave, or at least move somewhere where my arse wasn't hurting so much. Melvin sighed and shook his head.

"I don't know what I felt, to be honest. I started out with a simple idea: that Transhumanism is wrong, that tinkering with ourselves is wrong. It's everywhere, Melvin. And no one is asking the big questions. Do it yourself gene-therapy, people putting devices in their brains, people trying to create artificial life, it is happening all around us. How's it all going to end? That is what I wanted to ask. No one knows! Sally, Jesus, she's just a kid. Was a kid. If we just cut through the emotion, for a moment, my question to you that day *is* valid. In order to keep her alive, you made her something else. The likes of Lia and Gray, they are no longer the same as what they were before. I just want to ask the question. It wasn't meant to be an attack. Really, I am sorry."
