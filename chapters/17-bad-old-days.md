# bad old days

I went to see Joan the following day. She lived in an elegant apartment in Chelsea. She was still angry about the fact Melvin had taken me to see Sally. "Was she awake?" She demanded of me. I told her that Melvin had said she was sleeping. I had noticed the camera over her head. "He has no idea that man. I bet she was awake. She has done that to me. Kids love to snoop, and Sally is no different. She pretends to be asleep, but is listening or just watching you. As I said, she does it to me all the time."

The bright paint on the walls, the flowers, the cards, they made sense now. Of course!

I coaxed a reluctant Joan back to the time before, when there was only text communication with her daughter. She told me that the initial joy she felt at sharing words with Sally only briefly lifted her from her previous despair. "What kind of existence was it? What was she, a little girl or a machine?" She is still troubled by what Sally was, she told me.

"I have to tell you Charles, I don't think I was ever happy about what happened to Sally. I know, I know, what mother could wish their child dead. But I had mourned. I had begun grieving for her when my father had been convinced by that woman to let Sally have that operation. I was furious. I had him arrested. I hated him!" Joan fell silent often for long periods when we had met. It was as if she was searching for the right words, words that could describe the indescribable struggle of a mother losing her child. She had lost her physically to the virus; she had lost her mind to Melvin and the machines they attached her to.

"No. My baby girl has gone. I still have a daughter, but she is not the child I brought into the world. Not the girl I raised and loved. That girl has gone, and I am hated for it, saying what I feel. I can see it in their eyes, in the way they speak. At best they pity me. I know my own father does that, pity me." She fell back into another reverie. I waited.

"That woman had come to one day," Joan suddenly said. "You know that manipulative bitch DiCosta. She had managed to convince my father to attach her to the Internet, so she can have more to do, more to seek, something to distract her from her, how did she say it? Her 'predicament'." Joan laughed, a hard, bitter laugh. "I mean now she could watch YouTube all day instead of speaking to her 'stupid' mother! It did mean I got some sleep though." Sally's mothers face was hard and thin and constantly a slight tension played across her lips and nose, as if she was hurting in some way. It did mean she looked at you as if you were beneath her. She looked a snob. Though I saw nothing that made her one. It was just a look on her face.

"DiCosta was then all excited. Her Internet experiment was a big hit with Sally. But she didn't want to stop there. She wanted to conduct more surgery on Sally. I said no. Actually I said over my dead body. But Dad was keen on the idea. I still think he was fucking that woman. Had to be. He was like her puppy. It was repulsive." She paused again, but this time as if regaining her wind for a final push. To get it all out.

"So, I had an idea. Or I thought I did. I said they should ask Sally what she wanted. 'We should all stop making decisions for her without even asking if she wanted them,' I told them. So they did. She was nuts for it. The brat knew more about the options than we did." She laughed again, this time there was tenderness in it. "She was remarkably  well informed, she knew what she wanted. She wanted sight and hearing." Joan's voice cracked and her eyes pooled, wet and she sucked in air across her teeth. "She told me, she wanted a hug from me and be able to feel it."

A single tear broke the banks of her one eye and she pushed across her cheek and away with the back of her index finger.
Is is about 10 o'clock in the morning when Joan knocks on the door. There was no answer from the downstairs intercom. She knows her mother rarely goes out, so either the intercom is not working or she is drunk and asleep. A old woman with tightly permed, almost orange, hair had come out of the lobby door and Joan had gone in and up in the lift.

It takes nearly five minutes for Vi to come to the door. Joan had banged urgently on the door and yelled in a hushed tone through the letterbox. "Mum, let me in." She felt the hotness of her skin as she had thought of the people in the apartment block listening to her try to rouse her mother.

The door opens. "Joan! This is a lovely surprise. Sorry I was in the shower and couldn't have heard you." Vi stands there in her lurid pink and yellow dressing-gown that gaped awkwardly. Her skin and hair perfectly dry. She is heavily made up, but it is smudgy and poorly applied. "Come in, come in. Do you want a drink?"
"Tea. Do you have any milk?"
"Of course, I think. Let me check." Vi hustles down the corridor into the kitchen at the end of the hallway. "No, love. Sorry. How about coffee then?"
"Okay." Joan walks into the living room, not following her mother. The room is messy, with magazines and free papers on the floor. It is arranged as if the furniture had slid from side to side, like on a boat in a swelling sea, and settled at a point once the motion had stopped. A low coffee table lies close to a lounge chair, on it is a cushion with a bright knitted cover lined up with the chair. Across the table were drinks glasses and an overflowing ashtray. Opposite this a huge television that dominated the room.
Vi walks in with two large mugs of black coffee. She offers Joan one, hesitates then offers her the other.
"Thanks." Joan takes the mug and sits on the edge of the sofa that is at an awkward angle to everything else in the room.
"You're welcome. So good to see you. Do you like my new TV? Melvin bought it, I believe. Turned up one day. I told the delivery man to take it away, horrible thing. So vulgar! But he insisted and so here it is. How is your father?"
"He's good. He's happy that we've managed to reach Sally and we can now communicate with her."
"Does he know you've come to see me?"
"It's none of his business who I see, mum."
"So you're not happy then. You only come to see me if you're unhappy. When you're happy and things are good, I never see you from one month to the next." Vi sips from her coffee cup and looks over it at Joan who is looking down at the thick carpet that needs a clean.
"So," Vi smiles, "you're not happy at the situation you've got yourself in, are you sweetheart."
"What situation, mum?" Joan's voices is soft and quiet.
"Sally of course. You let them do that to her. How could you? You know it's wrong, poor baby. You've seen what they have been saying on the TV. I was talking to Mrs Hawkins downstairs - funny lady, younger than me if you can believe it. Well, she has her granddaughter around all the time, like I used to. I couldn't now could I, not now Sally is, well, you know."
Joan reached across and put her cup down on the coffee table. Vi placed her hand on Joan's arm and says, "It's not right, Joan. It's not natural. I mourned her when she died and now I hear she's back on a computer. They say so on TV. It's more than I can take." Vi takes a gulp from the coffee cup and looks at the TV accusingly.
"She didn't die, mum, for Christ's sake! She's alive. She's just, well," her voice trailing away as she pinches her lips together, her eyes wet.
"I had a gentleman caller, Joan! I forgot to say."
"Nobody says that, mum, 'a gentleman caller'. You sound like you're living in nineteen-fifty."
"More's the pity we're not. Those were better days, I can tell you," Vi says as she swills the rest of the coffee cup's contents into her thin mouth.
"Hmmm, because you were a small child then." Joan looks about the room, her arm following her gaze. "Not much has changed really though I guess, just no one about to pick up after you."
Vi's face hardens. "Don't come the smart-arse with me, girl. You come here and laugh at me? You're disgusting, what you've done. Charles agrees with me. What a lovely man, the kind that would sort you out and your 'daddy' issues. He said..."
"Who's Charles?"
"Charles Godwin, you must have seen him on TV."
"I haven't been watching much TV mum, I've been busy, if you didn't notice."
"I wouldn't know, sweetheart. I only know what is going on from the TV. No one tells me anything. Anyway he said that people were doing unnatural things. This was against nature, against God."
Joan laughs a tight and bitter laugh. "God, really? Since when did you start believing in God?"
"There's lots of things you don't know about me," Vi snaps. "You think you know everything. But you don't. If you did you wouldn't have done that to my granddaughter. Charles said that you've been tricked. There is this organisation, Brighter Future they're called, who are trying to make new humans. An army of zombie-like people to take over the world. They have done this to Sally."
"What are you talking about? Fucking zombies - mum really?"
"It's true, I tell you. Charles and some other people are trying to stop them before it's too late. If they don't, one day we'll all wake up and these people will be in charge - it's like Nazi Germany, these people are trying to make a master race." Vi stopped. "How do you feel about Sally? Are you happy with how she is? You can't be. I'm not. It's horrible. That's not living. It's a computer game. Like those ones that kids spend all their time playing, rather than going outside and meeting real people. What sort of life is she going to have? None." Vi is on a roll, now. Her monologue seems not really meant for Joan, who is sinking into her seat as if crushed by the onslaught of thoughtless words. "What happens when she is a teenager, that's not long away? She meets noone her age. She can't, can she? She's a zombie. They can do some cruel things nowadays, in the name of medical science. Progress they call it. I call it abomination! Poor girl, she has become a circus freak. People are using her and you're letting them. I wasn't much of a mother, but I'd never have allowed that."

Joan stands up, her head swimming so she has to lean down to steady herself with a hand. Vi leans her hand down to the side of her chair and picks up another mug. She drinks from it, staring at the television. "I'm off, mother. I'll let my self out." She moves out of the room and towards the front the door.
"Do that," Vi says. She takes another gulp from the new cup and picks up the TV remote.
Joan walks out of the apartment, the sound of the too loud TV is silenced with the slam of the door.
