# one can't live on words alone

I was raining heavily the next time I went to see Melvin. The bare trees on the street outside now had fat buds that were waiting for the warmth of the sun. None was coming that morning. The sky was almost black. Lights were on in every house on the street. Cars had their headlights on. The rain bounced up from the pavement soaking my shoes and trouser bottoms even though I was well covered with a vast blue umbrella. I was so wet that Melvin insisted I remove my shoes and trousers to dry; so I sat on the leather sofa in pyjama bottoms a hand-length too long and wearing slippers a size too small.

He told me that the initial joy and emotion of being able to connect to Sally had quickly faded. Melvin said, "the messages from Sally were a deluge of questions and conversation; she never seemed to sleep, it was as if they were to stop, they may never start again. I was exhausted, but if I stopped for any reason, she would be angry and upset. Joan just did not have the stamina required, either in staying connected or in the quality of communication. Sally was often mean to her mother and had mocked her for being 'stupid' on more than one occasion. The media were also now interested. At first Joan and I tried hard to keep them at bay, but we were worn down at the edges. We were all fraying. Then all hell broke loose."

It had been Raphaella's idea to have Bright Futures hold a press conference. I have included the transcript here, rather than being accused of giving it any spin. I don't need to; it was gold to us at the time. I couldn't have paid for a better outcome, and those few minutes of misspoken airtime, in addition to Lia's information, now had Bright Futures painted as a shady organisation that no one should trust.

>"Good evening all, I am Anna Gardiner, BBC medical correspondent, reporting from the Queens Square Hospital, here in London. With me is Raphaella DiCosta, Director of Outreach at Bright Futures Cybernetics, who are based in California. Bright Futures have provided the Taylor family support and provide the technology that allows Sally to communicate. Good evening, Raphaella."  
>  
>"Good evening, Anna, I'm pleased to be here this evening."  
>  
>"So, let me ask the question we are all wanting to ask, how is Sally?"  
>  
>"Sally is doing well, Anna. It is early days, of course, and there is a lot we do not know yet, but all the early signs are good."  
>  
>"So as I understand it, that due to a recent illness, Sally had lost all motor functions and was until a week ago 'locked in' and could not communicate with anyone, is that correct?"  
>  
>"Yes, as far as we know, and I'd like to say there is a lot that we still don't know, Sally had some form of viral attack to her nervous system that left her conscious mind entirely disconnected. Unlike other cases of Locked-in Syndrome, which is probably the best definition we have for her condition we have right now, Sally not only has no motor function, but has no sensory inputs into her brain - so no sight, hearing, smell, touch or taste. This means that she is entirely cut off."  
>  
>"How did your team know that Sally was, in fact, still alive? I understand both the family and the medical team here had largely given up hope for her."  
>  
>"We have been monitoring for new cases of locked-in syndrome, and those defined as persistent vegetative state. We were aware of Sally's case. In many cases the patients are conscious, they just have no means of expressing it to outside world. In some cases, they can even have been determined dead, according to previously held medical definitions. Time is important with all these cases. We have found that the longer the patients are in this disconnected state, the less likely there is of reaching them. In Sally's case because her situation is particularly severe, it was vital we got to her as quickly as possible. Luckily, the technique we use in analysing the MRI data clearly showed that Sally was conscious. We got to her early and we were successful in connecting to her."  
>  
>"And this is what the operation was for: to give her a means of connecting to the outside world?"  
>  
>"Yes, we attached a neuroprosthetic device to Sally. This device allows for a computer to be in direct communication with Sally's brain."  
>  
>"So, a device was surgically attached to her brain, we understand it is called a 'Gate', and this 'Gate' allows her to communicate with the outside word via computer. This is correct, yes?"  
>  
>"Yes. Well, we do not refer to the neuroprosthetic as a 'Gate'. In fact, if I may say, that name maybe owned by another organisation. Actually, we do not have a marketable term for the device, it is a brain-computer-interface, or 'BCI', another term you may hear is 'cortical modem'. The device directly interfaces to neurons in Sally's brain and interprets the signals they produce. At present Sally can communicate using text. She is in almost constant contact with her mother and grandfather, as well as myself and my assistant, Kate Long."  
>  
>"How long will Sally have to communicate through the device?"  
>  
>"We do not know the answer to that, Anne. Not with any complete certainty. Unfortunately, both the team here and our own specialists do believe that the damage to Sally's nervous system is so great, it is unlikely she will ever recover."  
>  
>"So she will only be able to communicate through a computer, for the rest of her life. Is that correct?"  
>  
>"As I said, we do not know what the future holds, but for the time being that is the case, yes."  
>  
>"Does this raise any ethical questions, Ms DiCosta?"  
>  
>"Anne, I'm sorry I don't follow. What do you mean by ethical?"  
>  
>"Sally is 10 years-old. What quality of life is she to have? I'm sure that some people may see Sally's future as bleak, terrifying even."  
>  
>"Sally is alive, Anne. Bright Futures' technology has given her hope. I am uncertain: who would think that keeping her alive is a bad thing? Who knows what we may learn from this."  
>  
>"So, you're seeing Sally as an experiment, then?"  
>  
>"Not at all. We hope to help Sally gain a means of interaction with the world that will provide her with a good degree of quality of life later on. And, yes, along the way we will learn things that I hope will expand our understanding of how the brain works and how we can better interact with it."  
>  
>"This technology gives hope to other locked-in or persistent vegetative state patients is what you saying, yes?"  
>  
>"I think we need to be cautious about making any bold claims at this time. We are not looking to widen this trial to other patients."  
>  
>"That does contradict you earlier statement somewhat. You stated that Bright Futures monitored other patients."  
>  
>"We are monitoring, but not looking to widen our usage of the device at this time. We are focussing on improving Sally's quality of life."  
>  
>"Quality of life, you say. I understand that even her mother feels that Sally has no quality of life. She cannot be touched, or held, things felt by most as vital to any quality of life."  
>  
>"As I said, we hope to improve her situation over time."  
>  
>"And you do not intend to use Sally as a guinea pig to further develop your technology?"  
>  
>"As I said, I really do not understand the purpose of your current questions, Anne."  
>  
>"Bright Futures has not leaked their technology to allow regulated usage by an underground transhuman movement?"  
>  
>"No, Anne. We have been made aware that there are people who are connecting devices to themselves, but Bright Futures is not involved, in any way."  
>  
>"And Bright Futures is not developing military solutions?"  
>  
>"I'm sorry Anne, I thought this interview was about what we are doing to help Sally and her family. We are way off topic here."  
>  
>"So you are not answering the question, Ms DiCosta?"  
>  
>"No we are not."  
>  
>"Thank you for your time Ms DiCosta."  
>  

Poor Raphaella, she had really dropped the ball. And we just picked it up and ran with it. We ignited discussion of the interview through social media. People love conspiracy theories, they love the idea that there are clandestine forces at work. They'd rather believe that than face the real truth. The real truth of things, I have found, is impenetrable to most people, a complex mystery that most would rather be simpler, even if that simplicity is a far-fetched fiction, like here. The truth is that everything is luck, a roll of the dice. No one likes that; no one likes the role of Fate's puppet.

Ditto. Need to make this look like social media.
