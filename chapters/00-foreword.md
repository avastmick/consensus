  In the near future technology is encroaching on our biology. People are changing themselves into something new. Amidst it all is a young girl who falls mysteriously ill. Her mother and grandfather are desperate. Opposing forces circle, seeing her as an opportunity to further their cause. The options to save her life are stark and may leave her less than human.

# Foreword
<span class="firstLetter">B</span>ooks that concern themselves with the future are always in danger of making themselves a mockery. In particular, this is true of books that describe the near future, so I am putting myself, deliberately, in a situation where derision is likely. To lessen the inevitable effects, I have taken some precautions to help avoid almost immediate anachronism.

Firstly, this book is not intended to be prophetic. I have no crystal ball. Secondly, the time it is set is uncertain. I suggest it could be set anywhere from five to twenty years in the future. Lastly, I have based the science of currently existing technology: that is to say, that every gadget and device already exists in 2017 in some form or other and that their concept has already been proven.

I hope you enjoy it, and are not too dismissive if my depiction of the future is not quite right.
