My problems began with Sally Taylor. Everything had gone so well to that point. We were making a good impact on social media and the general news was running stories on Transhumanism, with our input. We felt we had real momentum, given the push we had from Lia's information. However, there is no defence against something like Sally; any progress we made was thrown back by that unfortunate ten year-old girl. How can you pick a fight with that? How can you attack the morals of a helpless, grieving mother? Or take to task a despairing grandfather? You cannot. Look, I know, I tried, but it gained me nothing; no, that's not correct - that fight cost me everything. Sally's story is remarkable. Even I was moved by the sequence of events that led to meet. Who wasn't? Afterall, when is any price too high when it comes to save a child's life? anyway I liked it

I met Melvin Taylor at his house a few months ago. The street he lives on is the epitome of suburban comfortable living; hence the name of the place, Surbiton, Surrey, England. It is lined, nose to tail, with nice, shiny cars, on either side. This makes the street feel narrow; but, means that the traffic is slow. The pavement is wide and grows, at even intervals, plane trees. Melvin's home is a clean-bricked, three-story town house that stands mid-way along the street. It had inviting yellow lights that spilt from the windows, brightening the evening of the grey day when I first visited.

Inside was warm. Thick colourful rugs covered the bare wooden flooring. And on one, Melvin told me, Sally, then ten years-old, had sat, cross-legged, her hands supporting her head, her elbows on her knees, on that day their life changed. "We were playing chess," he recalled, "and Sally, so bright and quick, used to taunt me, 'It's your go, grandad. You're sooo slow,' she'd say. You see, I remember every detail of that afternoon, as if I could access, on demand, a looped home movie in my mind." Melvin had played this loop over and over, many times, that he can recall every word, every gesture, as if they were happening right there, before him, right now.

"I remember her sighing, 'So slow. It will be dark, and you said we were going to the park.' I slid a pawn one space forwards. 'There,' I had said. I hung my hand for a moment over that piece, hesitating. 'All that thinking for that!' Sally had giggled, then she leaned acutely from the hips, snatched up my hesitant pawn with one hand and slid her bishop onto its place with the other. 'Check!' She laughed. I remember kidding her, 'Ahh, now I have you.' You know, putting on this frown, a mock frown of deep thought. I was losing, so I told her, 'To save your embarrassment, let's go to the park now. We can finish this game when we get back.' She teased me back, 'Sure, grandad, because I am *so* going to lose. Let's go.' I remember just how she easily lifted herself on the spot, her legs elegantly unfolding as she rose. And how she stretched and dashed off down the corridor, her dark hair bouncing across her back. I compared it to the way I had levered myself up into a seated position. How I awkwardly picked up the chess board and placed it on the coffee table. How I had pushed up on one knee, and how I had creaked himself upright. Above all, how I had followed her happily. I remember it all.

"We had wrapped up warm that day, with coats and scarves and hats. Along the street was a narrow alleyway. We walked down it, Sally chatted constantly, I only partially listened, really, but well enough, so any question she threw out could be answered. I had this smile on my face all the way. I watched Sally skip and twist and jump alongside me. She had given me her energy that day." As Melvin watched the movie loop, he often felt the urge to stop them, and send them back into the warm, he told me.

"After some time the alleyway ended at another street. The end of this street was open, with no houses. Naked trees pressed in there, towards a large black wrought-iron gate. It gives entry to the park beyond. We opened the gate and went in," he told me. "The gate had clanged behind us. I had looked back at that gate. It had made such a noise. Sally had run off, jumping and swirling, her cheeks were pink in the cold air. I crunched along the gravel path after her. Under the damp trees I could see my breath. It was cold. We climbed, the zigzagging path, up the park rise, towards a shiny, silver, winter's sky of that day. *The* day.
At the top of the rise we stopped. I was out of breath and sat on the bench there. I remembered the view, back across the city, and the how the air was clear, and sprawl of London stretched out before us: houses after houses. I said to her, 'Look at all those people, Sally!' Sally was stood behind me on the grass bank, her shoes wet and muddy. Vividly, I can recall that she was quiet now, for the first time that day. 'A lot of people, Sally, all chatting on, making noise,' I said to her, knowing she always bit at the bait of this comment. But Sally was still for a moment, staring towards something, her face pale. 'You okay, chicken?' I asked her. And I knew she was not, 'Can we go, I don't feel so good,' she had said. I had wanted to get her back in the warm and had worried that her mother, Joan, would have been mad at getting her so cold. I stood up from the bench, and as I did so, Sally had slowly fallen. The knees of her woollen tights had sunk into the soft grass. I remember grasping her arms and lifting her onto her feet.

"We walked back down the gravel path and I held Sally's hand gently as we went. Her hand was cold. She was walking slowly. But I did not hold it hard enough, as when we approached the gate again, she stumbled and fell. She had slipped from my grasp and had fallen heavily on her face. I can clearly hear the sound of her face crunching into the gravel, even now. I lifted her up, and she slumped over my shoulder, my arms gripping beneath her legs. She was a big girl for ten; she was so tall. But you know what? I can't remember her weight as walked back to the house, with her in my arms. I was just so worried. I fled back.

"Back at the house, she was brighter, chatting again, warming up. I had made her take off her muddy tights and put on warm pyjamas bottoms. I made her hot chocolate. She looked better and my anxiety had ebbed. I asked her, 'Wanna finish the game? I feel bad though, as I'm going to beat you.' Sally had been defiant, as always, 'Yeah, right. When did you last win a game, when I was like, what, eight?" She lifted the board back onto the floor. She plopped down cross-legged in her usual manner, except she had tilted awkwardly. I can see now, her hand going forward and landing in the middle of that board, to catch herself. I can still see the chess pieces tumble. And I just stood there, staring at Sally. I didn't know what to do, what was wrong. She had started to cry. She tried to pick the pieces up, but somehow her hands fumbled them and she knocked the remaining pieces across the board.

"As this scene plays in his mind, my heart always sinks to my stomach," he said to me. "I dropped to my knees next to her and held her. 'It's okay, it's okay. You've got cold and your body is playing up. I've got you, Grandad's got you,' I said, over and over. Sally leant into me and I surrounded her with my arms. Over and over, I said, 'Grandad's got you.'" Melvin told me that those words echo in his head, over and over, 'Grandad's got you.' But he hadn't. She was sick, as we now all know. Something was very wrong with Sally, something very rare and strange.

"God, it happened so quickly. After that day, it was as if every minute she diminished. It was fast, so fast. Mid-afternoon, she was skipping up the path in the park. Within five hours she was in hospital. By that time, she could no longer walk without assistance. The doctors don't know what was wrong. They're clueless. The poor child was terrified at what was happening to her. By the time, Joan, Sally's mother arrives at the hospital, she was finding it hard to handle things with her hands and her speech was not right, she was mispronouncing things. Joan was furious. She is shouting at the doctors. They want to move her. They wanted to send her to the National Hospital For Neurology and Neurosurgery at Queen's Square. They thought that her condition was neurological, that there was something wrong with her brain. I got in the ambulance with Sally. Her mother was still raving at the doctor's. She was crying and crying. Joan was in total panic by this point. She was not helping things. So I left her there and went with Sally. I was terrified. By the time we got to Queens Square, Sally was immobile and her speech was slurred and barely coherent. On the way in she had a convulsion. She was frothing at the mouth, her legs and arms thrashing about. It was midnight. As the medical team rushed her into the ICU, she went into cardiac arrest. She was dying, right there in front of me.

"Joan arrived. It was chaos. She was literally wrestling with two nurses out in the corridor. I could see through the glass of the door into the ICU. They were on the floor, grappling. She was raving. Meanwhile, the medical team in the ICU worked on. It was surreal. The madness in the corridor. The alarms and beeps inside the room. They stabilised her. They just worked through the chaos. She was on a ventilator and her heart was driven artificially. The doctors were damning in their prognosis. There is no sign of life. Sally's mother just fell apart. She sat in the hallway on a chair, alone. The knees of her tights were ripped. I sat, next to what I felt was the corpse of my granddaughter. I held her hand. Slowly she had slipped away, and left locked-in with no evident external sign that she had anything left of the bright young girl she was only hours earlier. I don't know, even then, and God that was a low moment; even then, I somehow *knew* she wasn't dead. I *knew* it. Somehow.

"Life then became suspended. For the next week, I lived at the hospital, and mostly in that room, with Sally. In that room, with it's bleeping and flashing lights. I was numb. The doctors did scans of her brain. They showed 'something', they said, but they could not get her to react to any other physical stimulus. I was stubborn. I said to them that maybe it happened so fast that her body had just shut down. I said that maybe she just needed time. I felt there was pressure. There was a consensus that Sally was beyond hope now. Everyone felt, but did not explicitly say, that there was only one course of action. I was not having it. She needed time, I said. I forbade any discussion of switching off life-support. Joan became angry. Ten days after Sally had fallen sick, I found my daughter with her. She had dressed her in new bed clothes and brushed her hair; she had made her look nice. When I came in, she was speaking to Sally. She was saying goodbye! I was furious. I brought in a legal friend of mine to ensure that nothing was done without my say so. Joan wanted the life-support turned off, 'so she could mourn,' she said.

"I managed to get Joan away from the hospital, for a while at least. Her crazed incident in the corridor had become useful at least. The doctors were patient with me, I'll give them that. They understood. They even admitted the brain scans were puzzling, and confessed that *something* may be going on in there. But, to a person, they could never find me any hope of improvement. 

"Then, two weeks after Sally was admitted, Raphaella arrived at the hospital. She supported my view and asked that her team review the brain scan data. It was a huge change. They too believed that Sally was still alive, her brain was functioning. However, this time, and unlike the doctors at the hospital, they had an idea, something to try to save Sally's life. As with all things, but I have found with medical people in particular, people are proud when something new comes along to contradict a well held point of view. The doctors did not like the idea that Raphaella and her team from *Bright Futures Cybernetics* proposed. The proposal was that Sally undergo surgery and have a *brain computer interface* attached. What everyone is now calling, a *Gate*.

"The doctor's response was nothing compared to Joan's. She was apoplectic with rage. Again though, her behaviour helped me. This time, security had her removed when she started threatening staff. Raphaella organised that Sally be taken for another scan, with her medical team conducting the MRI. This, as you know, was a ruse. While Sally was in the MRI suite, the *Bright Futures* team operated and attached the device. Raphaella, walked me through what was happening and how I could communicate with Sally, and with luck she would be able to respond.

<!-- This fills in the detail from Lia's description. Melville is a much more fastidious narrator. -->

"Of course, nothing happens, not then. Joan found out and, while we are still trying to get through to Sally, the police arrive. I was arrested. Hope is fading and the mother wants to have the Gate removed. The doctors warn that another surgery may be fatal. The woman secretly arranges for the Gate to remain connected by blackmailing the active consultant. She plays a text game with the girl to show how to communicate. Nothing.

The woman speaks with the grandfather, who is on bail. She says it looks like it has not worked at that the girl may not be able to understand how to interact. The grandfather presses and asks for access. She enables a remote means of text-based access.
