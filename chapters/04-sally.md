# Chapter 4 - Sally

We were making real progress. Everything was going well. We had Lia embedded at *Bright Futures*. We were influencing social media and the general news outlets. The stories were spreading of the threat that transhumanism brought to our way of life. We believed we had real momentum, given the push we had from Lia's information. Then came Sally Taylor. She looked, at first, another terrific opportunity for us. In fact, our problems started with her. All progress we had made was thrown back by that unfortunate ten year-old girl. How can you pick a fight with that? How can you attack the morals of a grieving mother? Or take to task the actions of a despairing grandfather? You cannot. Look, I know, I tried, and it cost me everything. 

Sally's story is a remarkable tale of persistence. Faced with an insurmountable wall of evidence, some still clung to a delicate hope. While many may feel that an ethical line was crossed by those close to her, you have to ask, when is any price too high when it comes to the life of a child? 

I met Sally's grandfather at his house a few months back. Melvin Taylor lived then on a street that is the epitome of suburban comfortable living, in Richmond, Surrey. It was lined, nose to tail, with nice, shiny cars, on either side. This made the street feel narrow; but, meant that the traffic is slowed. The pavement was wide and plane trees grew, at even intervals along it. Melvin's home was a clean-bricked, three-story town house that stood mid-way along the street. It was set back from the street with a neat, cobbled parking area out front. It had inviting yellow lights that spilt from the windows, brightening the evening of the grey day when I first visited.

Inside was warm. Thick colourful rugs covered the bare wooden flooring. And on one, Melvin told me, Sally, then ten years-old, had sat, cross-legged, her hands supporting her head, her elbows on her knees, on that day their life changed. "We were playing chess," he recalled, "and Sally, so bright and quick, used to taunt me, 'It's your go, grandad. You're sooo slow,' she'd say. You see, I remember every detail of that afternoon, as if I could access, on demand, a looped home movie in my mind." Melvin had played this memory over and over, many times, so that he could recall every word, every gesture, as if they were happening right there, before him, right then.

"I remember her sighing," he told me, "'So slow. It will be dark, and you said we were going to the park.' I slid a pawn one space forwards. 'There,' I had said. I hung my hand for a moment over that piece, hesitating, uncertain that it would be wise. 'All that thinking for that!' Sally had giggled, then she leaned acutely from the hips, snatched up my hesitant pawn with one hand and slid her bishop onto its place with the other. 'Check!' She laughed. I remember kidding her, 'Ahh, now I have you.' You know, putting on this frown, a mock frown of deep thought. I was losing, so I told her, 'To save your embarrassment, let's go to the park now. We can finish this game when we get back.' She teased me back, 'Sure, grandad, because I am *so* going to lose. Let's go.' I remember just how she easily lifted herself on the spot, her legs elegantly unfolding as she rose. And how she stretched and dashed off down the corridor, her dark hair bouncing down her back. I compared it to the way I had levered myself up into a seated position. How I awkwardly picked up the chess board and placed it on the coffee table. How I had pushed up on one knee, and how I had creaked himself upright. Above all, how I had followed her happily. I remember it all.

"We had wrapped up warm that day, with coats and scarves and hats. Along the street was a narrow alleyway. We walked down it, Sally chatted, I half-listened, so any questions she threw out could be answered and I would avoid the chastisement for not paying her my full attention. I had this daft smile on my face all the way. I watched her skip and twist and jump. I had energy just from her being at my side." As Melvin watched the movie loop, he told me how he had thought, many times, how much he wanted to go back in time and tell himself to take Sally home, back into the warm.

"After some time," he continued, "the alleyway ended. The street beyond was closed at one end, not with houses houses, but a high, red-brick wall. Naked trees pressed in there, towards a large black wrought-iron gate. It gave entry to the park beyond. We opened the gate and went in," he told me. "The gate clanged behind us. I had looked back at that gate; it made such a noise. Sally ran off, jumping and swirling, her cheeks pink in the cold air. I crunched along the gravel path after her. Under the damp trees I could see my breath. It was cold. We climbed the zigzagging path, up the park rise, towards the shiny, silver, winter's sky of that day. *The* day.

At the top of the rise we stopped. I was out of breath and sat on the bench there. I remember the view, back across the city, and the how the air was clear, and sprawl of London stretched out before us, houses after houses. I said to her, 'Look at all those people, Sally!' Sally was stood behind me on the grass bank, her shoes wet and muddy. I can remember she was quiet now, for the first time that day. 'A lot of people, Sally, all chatting on, making noise,' I said to her. I knew she always bit at the bait of this comment, but not that time. Sally was still for a moment, staring towards something distant, her face pale. 'You okay, chicken?' I asked. And I knew she was not, 'Can we go, I don't feel so good,' she said. I  wanted to get her back in the warm and worried that her mother, Joan, would be mad at getting her so cold. I stood up from the bench. As I did so, Sally slowly fell. The knees of her woollen tights sank into the soft grass. I remember grasping her arms and lifting her onto her feet.

"We walked back down the gravel path and I held Sally's hand gently as we went. Her hand was cold. She was walking slowly. I did not hold it hard enough. As when we approached the gate again, she stumbled and fell. She slipped from my grasp and fell heavily on her face. I can clearly hear the sound the gravel crunching into her cheek, even now. I lifted her up again, and she slumped over my shoulder, my arms gripping beneath her legs. She was a big girl for ten; she was so tall. But you know what? I can't remember her weight as walked back to the house, with her in my arms. I was so worried. I fled back.

"Back at the house, she brightened, chatting again, warming up. I made her take off her muddy tights and put on warm pyjamas bottoms. I made her hot chocolate. She drank it and looked better, and my anxiety ebbed. I asked her, 'Wanna finish the game? I feel bad though, as I'm going to beat you.' Sally was defiant, as always, 'Yeah, right. When did you last win a game, when I was like, what, eight?" She lifted the board back onto the floor. She plopped down cross-legged in her usual manner, except she tilted awkwardly. I can see now, her hand going forward and landing in the middle of that board, to catch herself. I can still see the chess pieces tumble. And I just stood there, staring at Sally. I didn't know what to do. What was wrong? She had started to cry. She tried to pick the pieces up, but somehow her hands fumbled them and she knocked the remaining pieces across the board.

"As this scene plays in my mind, my heart always sinks to my stomach," he said. "I dropped to my knees next to her and held her. 'It's okay, it's okay. You've got cold and your body is playing up. I've got you, Grandad's got you,' I said, over and over. Sally leant into me and I surrounded her with my arms. Over and over, I said, 'Grandad's got you, Grandad's got you.' But I hadn't, had I. She was sick, we know that now. Something was very wrong with Sally, something very rare and dangerous.

"God, it happened so quickly. It were as if at each minute's passing she diminished. It was fast, so fast. Mid-afternoon, she was skipping up the path in the park. Within five hours she was in hospital. By that time, she could no longer walk without assistance. The doctors didn't know what was wrong. They still don't, they are clueless. The poor child was terrified at what was happening to her. By the time Joan, Sally's mother, arrives at the hospital, she was finding it hard to handle things with her hands. Her speech was not right, she was mispronouncing things. Joan was furious. She is shouting at the doctors. Their doubt fuelled her rage. To her they weren't doing anything. To her the change to Sally was abrupt, she had not seen the change, as fast as it was. The doctor's wanted to move her. They wanted to send her to the National Hospital For Neurology and Neurosurgery at Queen's Square. They thought that her condition was neurological, that there was something wrong with her brain. Joan was demanding what was wrong with Sally. Her child was dying and she was throwing insults at the people who had tried to save her life. I got in the ambulance with Sally, her mother still raving at the doctor's. Sally was crying and crying. Joan was in total panic. But, she was not helping things. So, I left her there and went with Sally. I was afraid too. By the time we got to Queens Square, Sally was immobile and her speech was slurred and barely coherent. On the way in she had a convulsion. She frothed at the mouth, her legs and arms thrashing about. It was midnight. As the medical team rushed her into the ICU, she went into cardiac arrest. She was dying, right there in front of me.

"Joan arrived. She shouted. She roared her terror at everyone near. It was chaos. I heard her, then saw her. She was literally wrestling with two nurses out in the corridor. I could see it through the glass pane of the ICU door. They were on the floor, grappling. She made animal noises. her mouth and eyes were wet and wide. The nurses were trying to restrain her. Meanwhile, the medical team in the ICU worked on. It was surreal. The madness in the corridor. The alarms and beeps inside the room. They stabilised Sally. They just worked through the noise. She was on a ventilator and her heart driven artificially. The doctors were damning in their prognosis. There is no obvious sign of life. Joan fell apart. The fury was let out and she deflated. She sat in the hallway on a chair, alone. The knees of her tights were ripped. There was a bright drop of blood on the front of her white blouse. I sat in ICU, next to what I felt was the corpse of my granddaughter. I held her hand. She had slipped away, and she left no external sign of life. I could not tell there was anything left of the bright young girl she was only hours earlier. Somehow, I don't know how, even then, I *knew* she wasn't dead. I *knew* it.

"Life then became suspended. For the next week, I lived at the hospital, and mostly in that room, with Sally. In that room, with it's bleeping and flashing lights. I was numb. Then Sally's heart resumed. It was the faintest of hopes. The doctors did scans of her brain. They showed 'something', they said, but they could not get her to react to any physical stimuli. I was stubborn. I said to them that maybe it happened so fast that her body had just shut down. I said that maybe she just needed time. I felt pressure. There was a consensus that Sally was beyond hope now. Everyone felt, but did not explicitly say, that there was only one course of action. I was not having it. She needed more time, I said. I forbade any discussion of switching off life-support. Joan became angry. Ten days after Sally had fallen sick, I found my daughter with her. She had dressed her in new bed clothes and brushed her hair; she had made her look nice. When I came in, she was speaking to Sally. She was saying goodbye! I was furious. I brought in a legal friend of mine to ensure that nothing was done without my say so. Joan wanted the life-support turned off, 'so she could mourn,' she said.

"I managed to get Joan away from the hospital, for a while at least. Her crazed incident in the corridor had become useful. The doctors were patient with me, I'll give them that. They understood. They even admitted the brain scans were puzzling, and confessed that *something* may be going on in there. But, to a person, they could never give me any hope of improvement. Sally's life was balanced on a knife edge. Joan was in mourning. The doctors at the hospital were equally as decided. The overwhelming view was there was no hope left. I was the only voice left opposing it all, you know, termination. My position was that even if there were only the faintest glimmer of a chance, it was better to wait. I refused to be rushed into any decision. There was no harm in waiting. But the pressure was mounting. It was unbearable.

"Then, two weeks after Sally was admitted, Raphaella arrived at the hospital. She came through the place like a wind. Her glamorous charm and persuasiveness changed the air; she changed everything. Raphaella was a very easy person to like. She had that southern belle accent and a calm, low tone; nothing seemed to fluster her. When things got really tense, and most situations were tense then, she would smile and you could feel the air in the room lighten and everyone relax a little. It was a fantastic talent, it really was. If I still had my business, I would have tried to hire her. I came to love that woman.

"She asked me for access to Sally. I agreed. I even managed to convince Joan it was a good idea. It was the last throw of the dice, I told her. Raphaella's team reviewed the data and evaluated Sally's condition. They were thorough. Raphaella used her charm to ensure the local medical team stayed engaged and responsive. Her team were respectful of the work done at the hospital and they made their respect known. But they had unique experience the local team lacked. They had been involved in research and studies that showed a very different view of how locked-in patients were, compared to the thinking before that time. In their view, while Sally was very sick and her activity levels low, she was very much alive. I was angry. I took their carefully delivered results as a medical dressing up of oversights that should not have happened. These were experts in their field, how could they not know of the work being done? Raphaella was blunt with me. She told me in no uncertain terms that Sally was living at the very limit of medical knowledge. There were so many uncertainties, so many unknowns. She was deliberate in her remonstration; it was delivered in front of the medical teams. She wanted to bring everyone together, not divide them. As she put it to me, 'How will berating them help Sally? She needs everyone on her side right now. We all need to pull together.'

"Of course, not everyone was on the same side. There were agendas, some of which I still cannot get a grasp on. Raphaella was increasingly secretive. She put forward a plan for a battery of tests. This time, there was to be no stone left unturned. The schedule was for it to last between five and eight hours. She came to me that evening at my house. I needed to get out of the hospital for a while and take a shower, just have a change of scenery. I'd just got out of the shower when the doorbell went. I let her in, water still dripping off my hair. As soon as the door was closed she said, 'I have a plan, Melvin. It may save Sally's life. If you agree we will conduct surgery tomorrow during the tests.
