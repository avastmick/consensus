# Chapter 4

<span class="firstLetter">W</span>ITHOUT DOUBT, those days with Melvin were amongst the most emotional of my life. I am sure I can only fail in conveying the turmoil that he and Sally's mother, Joan, had lived through over the last year or so. Even as I recall these meetings and the frank monologues that Melvin gave, I find myself carrying shy of the real weight that burdened the man; I know I shrank from him emotionally as he unfolded his bleak tale. It was too much for any person.

Melvin Taylor was a tall man. I always thought that being tall at an old age was unexpected; it seemed to me a rare thing. For his age, in his mid-seventies, he was sprightly, slim and fit, and had that indescribable energy some people had, which ignited action in others. However, when Melvin spoke of these times, of Sally's illness, he seemed to reduce in stature and that spark of intensity dimmed, as if the story was hollowing him out, and each word of it carried a terrible cost to him. Nonetheless, he carried on, unfolding more and more to me, both the hopes and the despair, until I could see the extent to which he had been tortured by it all. I sat opposite him on a deep leather sofa in his living room, and sank into it while he went further into the detail of what happened to him.

"Two weeks after Sally was admitted," Melvin continued, "Raphaella DiCosta arrived at the hospital. She came through the place like a wind. Her glamorous charm and persuasiveness changed the air; she changed everything. Raphaella was a very easy person to like. She had that southern belle accent and a calm, low tone; I felt nothing flustered her. When things got really tense, and most situations were tense then, she would smile and you could feel the atmosphere in the room lighten and everyone relax a little. It was a fantastic talent, it really was. If I still had my business, I would have tried to hire that woman. I came to love her.

"She asked me for access to Sally. I agreed. She even managed to convince Joan it was a good idea. It was the last throw of the dice, she told her, what harm could it do. Raphaella's team reviewed the data and evaluated Sally's condition. They were thorough. Raphaella used her charm to ensure the local medical team stayed engaged and responsive. Her team were respectful of the work done at the hospital and they made their respect known. But they had unique experience the local team lacked. They had been involved in research and studies that showed a very different view of locked-in patients, compared to the thinking before that time. In their view, while Sally was very sick and her activity levels hard to measure, she was very much alive. This was great news, but it left me angry. I took their carefully delivered results as too soft, a medical dressing placed over professional malpractice. These were experts in their field, how could they not know of the work being done? Did they not read the studies and the papers on the numerous cases of patients, like Sally, who were unresponsive, but later pulled through? It was Raphaella who brought me back to my senses and gave me the slap I needed. She told me bluntly that Sally was at the very limit of medical knowledge and there were so many uncertainties and so many unknowns. She was deliberate in her remonstration; it was delivered in front of the medical teams. She wanted to bring everyone together, not divide them. As she put it to me, 'How will berating them help Sally? She needs everyone on her side right now. We all need to pull together.'

"Of course, not everyone was on the same side. There were agendas, some of which I still cannot get a grip on. Raphaella too was increasingly secretive. After a time, she put forward a plan for a battery of further tests on Sally. This time, there was to be no stone left unturned. If the plan was agreed, the schedule for the tests detailed them to last between five and eight hours. She came to me that evening at my house - I needed to get out of the hospital for a while and take a shower, get fresh clothes and just have a change of scenery. I'd just got out of the shower when the doorbell went. I let her in, water was still dripping off my hair. As soon as the door was closed she said, 'I have a plan, Melvin. It may save Sally's life. If you agree we will conduct surgery tomorrow during the proposed tests.' She was so direct, it took me aback. I asked her, 'Surgery to do what, exactly?' She was evasive, 'To make you understand, I need you to meet someone.' She pulled out her phone and spoke into it, 'Please, come in Gray, come and meet Melvin.' Raphaella opened the door. There stood a young man, no a woman dressed as a young man. She smiled and came in. 'Melvin, we don't have much time. Sally does not have much time. Gray, please show him.'

"Gray turned her head. At the back was a short ponytail, she pulled it out and parted the hair. There, neatly was a silver-grey circle with a small domed insert, about an inch across at most, maybe two. She tied her hair back up. We all went through and sat down in living room. I listened to what Gray had to say.  
    'This is a *Brain-Computer-Interface*, or BCI, some people call it a *Gate*, there are many words for it. Anyway, it is implanted directly into my brain. Through it I can connect directly to the Internet and to others with a similar device. We believe that such a device will help Sally, through it you will be able to communicate with her and she with you. She is locked-in, her body's senses have shut the world out, this device allows her a means of getting out.'"

Melvin continued, "I was knocked back to be honest. I had read something about it, years ago, they had managed to reach patients who were thought brain dead. They weren't,and their families had been able to communicate with them again through such a device. I looked at Gray, I'd have never thought that someone as healthy as she obviously was would have such a thing implanted in her brain. My thoughts, though, were interrupted. Raphaella was pressing me.
    'We need your approval to proceed, Melvin. The medical risks are known and manageable: we have done this a number of times,' she assured me. I felt trapped and pressured, but what else could I do? Without some means of connecting to her, Sally was dead to the world. Questions tumbled out, I was confused and worried. 'What can she do with it? If she has the surgery, that is. Are you certain it will work?'
    'I can't say, Melvin. We are confident that the surgery will go well, as much as we can be. But if Sally will be helped by it?.. I'm sorry, we're in the dark on that. We think so; we hope so. It has worked with other patients, as I said. It's got to be worth the role of the dice though, no?'"

"So, I agreed. I had to. You see that, right?" Melvin pleaded, to make me understand. I felt at that moment, he wanted me to forgive him, I guess. I looked at him sat on the chair opposite me, and he sank into it, and said to me, "Imagine utter sensory deprivation, Charles. Not like those fashionable tanks that allow you to float in a dark silence. This is utter. This is nothing. The only thing that exists is that which your own brain produces.

"In the void the brain does produce. It has to. Sensations drift across imagined limbs. An itch that can never be reached nor even fully identified where it comes from. A light flickers just out of sight; a rustle, a hiss just out of earshot. You are disembodied. You float with no concept of up or down, or front or back. The ghostly memories of your senses replay within the void, hinting at what maybe, was was and is now. The parts of your brain that think swiftest imagine threat and refuge. All that is real is self. Nothing but memories of what once was exists now. No new input to process. Nothing."

I struggled with the picture Melvin gave me. I could only make sense of it when recalling what Lia had told me, and her experience of the Gate-augmented connection: we never think of that deluge of data that floods our every waking moment; and even less of what it would be like without it. Our minds would crave essential nourishment and would wither and eventually die. Maybe not at an animal level, but the higher functions that make us, us; they would die surely, starved of the points of reference that maintain our conscious compass, we would drift away and diminish to nothing but our brute selves.

Melvin had spent more time on this philosophical problem than anyone, I'd imagine. He continued to explain, "Knowing that we are awake or asleep, is not something we often struggle with. There is enough information to tell us. Not for Sally then. First, when she woke and realised that she was awake, she would have been terrified. Then, over time, she understood what awake meant, I suppose. The initial twitching, itching, whispering glimmers that had so terrified her at first, would have faded. She then felt nothing. She felt no pain, no pleasure, no fear. She felt nothing at the idea of drifting away to nothing at all. Dreams," Melvin described, "were better to her then; waking had become just sleep. She could not remember being awake - nothing happened then. She knew she was awake; somehow she knew because there was nothing. When she dreamt at least stuff happened."

"You see, the doctors were so damning at that time. They kept saying the same things: 'I am sorry. Things are not looking good. We are struggling to tell now whether she is asleep or awake. In fact, we think that the active periods are not when she is awake at all, but when she is asleep, dreaming. I'm sorry,' they'd said. And I would say, 'I understand.' But, I didn't really. In fact, I wasn't really listening any more. I already knew the truth that she was slipping away, I could feel it. That's why, when Raphaella DiCosta came to me, I just said yes. I didn't really hesitate. Christ, if the child died during the operation, well, that would have been better than her slow maddening demise in the dark. I didn't care what Joan said, or anyone else. Sally needed some *hope*!"

"What did Joan say, Melvin, when you told her," I asked him.  
"What do you think? She said no. I think it was because Joan already thought Sally was dead. She must have thought, 'what was the point?' Look, we didn't really talk about it. Not in any detail, that is. She hated Raphaella."
"Is that when you went behind her back?" I asked him.
"Yes," Melvin said. "Well, not really. I suppose we thought - I mean Raphaella and I - we assumed Joan would not allow it. That was why Raphaella came up with a plan to get it done anyway. The five to eight hours planned for the tests was more than enough time to complete the surgery, she told me. We'd deal with the fallout afterwards. Of course, there was risk to us, Raphaella warned me that we were possibly outside the law, but I didn't care as long as Sally was given help.

"When we returned to the hospital, Raphaella called the medical teams together and ran through the plan for the tests. Given time zone differences between London and California, the tests were going to start late at night, so the remote team could feed back any findings they had during the tests. The local team wasn't needed - they had day jobs and would better benefit from some sleep, she told them. Raphaella made it all sound so innocuous, so routine. I remember my heart hammering as she ran through it all; I was shaking. At my cue, I announced I wanted to be present. I remember Joan giving me what looked like a dirty look." Melvin, leaned back further into the sofa and drew a deep breath. He was reliving that moment and the nervousness of it was still evident in his face. It was a huge gamble and it carried so much personal risk for him.

"So, tell me Melvin, you watched the operation. How was it done?" I asked him. I was intrigued, no one really had gone into any detail with me before. I suppose those I had spoken to about it were not conscious during the operation, so wouldn't know. I wanted more detail on what was done and how the device was attached to the brain.

"I may disappoint you, Charles," Melvin said, "I'm not a medical man and a lot of what happened wasn't clear to me. What I did see, was this: they wheeled Sally into the MRI room, with all her paraphernalia. They parked a partition outside so no one could see in. It was late, but they took no chances," he explained. "They then wheeled in operating materials and got right into it. Look, as I said, I didn't have the best view. I was at the back and the room was cramped, but I could see some of it, just not the detailed stuff, you know, the up-close work the surgeons did. There was a lot going on and I couldn't take it all in. They first turned Sally on her side and covered her, leaving only the back of her head exposed. One of the team then clipped away her hair in a wide circle, about a hand's width in diameter. The area was shaved to the skin and painted with iodine, or something else yellowy. I couldn't see the next bit, the surgeon was in the way. I could see at one point a tool being used, it looked like something you'd have in a wood-working shop. The surgeon stood back and I could see an area of Sally's yellowish-pink brain, there in the open, a neat hole revealed it. Then, another person took over who took a long while, with many items being passed to and fro. When they had finished the skull was back in place with a circular metal ring attached at the centre of the shaved area. You know, the same as Lia and Gray has. The first surgeon then returned to work and when he was done, it was finished. The skin had been pulled back up to the ring and it was all neatly stitched up. It looked neat work, from where I was stood. The second doctor then cleaned the area and placed a small domed object into the ring. A small blue light flashed. They rolled back onto her back, resting her head carefully on a cradle, so the head was supported, but the *Gate* was clear. They then rolled Sally out of the room and back into the ICU. It was all very slick and seemed almost routine to them.

"I resumed my usual seat at that time, next to Sally's bed in the ICU. I was tired. I had stood, watching the operation, for nearly four and a half hours. I dozed and was woken by Raphaella. She had a tablet in her hand, you know, like a big phone. She was excited and chatty and it woke me up.  
'This may take time,' she told me. 'Sally may not understand the signals at first. We are only going on what other candidates have found to work. No one was as young as she is.' I asked Raphaella, 'What do I do?' And she said, 'just type, a vocabulary of no more than three or four common words. Remember, short repeating words. Her name is best - repeat it often,' she explained."

I interrupted Melvin. "It was then you were arrested?"  
"Yes, not for a few hours though. I sat there, typing words, over and over, trying to get through to Sally" he explained. "The nurses came and went, as they did, checking the life-support, you know. About mid-morning, one of them saw the cradle. I said nothing. She left and a while later a doctor, one of the local team, came in. He asked me about it. I told him. I told him everything. He left and I just carried on, tapping away, hoping for something. Then, just after lunchtime, three police officers knocked on the door of the ICU. They arrested me for child abuse."

Melvin stopped and was silent, his story had sank to its nadir. I remembered when he was arrested. The media immediately responded in their usual fashion and Melvin was depicted as an abusive monster. They took Joan's words and twisted them out of context, making her complicit; her erratic behaviour allowing Melvin to carry out what he did. What was a intricate and private family tragedy became plain public debate overnight. There was a hysteria to it, the emotion of the public response was similar to Joan's tormented anger when Sally was first taken sick - it lashed out at everyone involved and Melvin in particular. And, of course, the media fanned the flames, pouring on fuel, encouraging the public to hurl invective at the family on fire, all supported by sponsored clicks and advertising minutes.

"How long were you in prison?" I asked Melvin, gently. He looked up, "Five days," he answered. "Nearly a week and it felt like months. See, they held me on remand - it was the media, I was all over the news. I spent the first night in a police cell, with the officers whispering abusive threats, banging on the cell door, scaring me. I was taken to court first thing in the morning for arraignment, then to Wormwood Scrubs, D Wing - for *high-risk prisoners*. I've never been so afraid in my life, Charles. I was kept alone, for my own protection, they said. I had no TV or Internet," he laughed, a short laugh. "I guess by the time I was out the media circus had moved on. I suppose I was spared all that, while I was in that cell.

"When I was bailed, Raphaella was there, with my solicitor. All I wanted to know is whether there was any change with Sally. I'd been cut off and it had been the worst torture. Raphaella was downcast - there had been no change. I went home and back to the tablet screen, tapping in the words, over and over. It was four in the morning when she replied."

So, that day, when he managed to get through to her, is not something we can easily imagine. Sally was on the brink of oblivion. "She thought she was asleep and dreaming," Melvin told me. "She was dreaming of letters. They had fallen across the dark then hung in space: meaningless. They had faded. Then they had reappeared. They had changed, but she did not understand. She said she felt tired and had drifted away to the memories of her body and senses of places and people past that were remade into new worlds for her to explore in her dreams. When she woke, the words were still there. A few simple words she could see and then she understood." Melvin laughed out loud, his face a picture of pleasure for the first time since I had sat with him. "I danced, I literally got up and danced about the room, when I read her words. I have never felt joy like that moment. I just kept staring at the screen of the tablet.

"'hello grandad.'"
