# Chapter 4

<span class="firstLetter">W</span>ITHOUT DOUBT, my few days with Melvin were amongst the most emotional of my life. I am sure I can only fail in conveying the turmoil that he and Sally's mother, Joan, had lived through over the last year or so. Even as I recall these meetings and the frank monologues that Melvin gave, I find my carrying shy of the real weight that burdened the man; I know I shrank from him as he unfolded his bleak tale. It was too much for any person.

Melvin was a tall man. I always think that being tall at an older age is unexpected; I do not know why. For his age, over seventy, he was healthy, slim and fit; he had that indescribable energy some people had, that seemed to ignite action in others. However, when he spoke of these times, of Sally's illness, he seemed to shrink in size and the spark of intensity, dimmed, as if the story was hollowing him out, it were as if each word carried a terrible cost to him. Nonetheless, he carried on, unfolding more and more to me until I could see the extent to which he had been tortured by it.

"Two weeks after Sally was admitted, Raphaella DiCosta arrived at the hospital. She came through the place like a wind. Her glamorous charm and persuasiveness changed the air; she changed everything. Raphaella was a very easy person to like. She had that southern belle accent and a calm, low tone; I felt nothing flustered her. When things got really tense, and most situations were tense then, she would smile and you could feel the atmosphere in the room lighten and everyone relax a little. It was a fantastic talent, it really was. If I still had my business, I would have tried to hire that woman. I came to love her.

"She asked me for access to Sally. I agreed. She even managed to convince Joan it was a good idea. It was the last throw of the dice, she told her, what harm could it do. Raphaella's team reviewed the data and evaluated Sally's condition. They were thorough. Raphaella used her charm to ensure the local medical team stayed engaged and responsive. Her team were respectful of the work done at the hospital and they made their respect known. But they had unique experience the local team lacked. They had been involved in research and studies that showed a very different view of locked-in patients, compared to the thinking before that time. In their view, while Sally was very sick and her activity levels low, she was very much alive. This was great news, but I was angry. I took their carefully delivered results as too soft, a medical dressing placed over professional malpractice. These were experts in their field, how could they not know of the work being done? Did they not read the studies and the papers on the numerous cases of patients, like Sally, who were unresponsive, but later pulled through? It was Raphaella who brought me back to my senses and gave me the slap I needed. She told me bluntly that Sally was at the very limit of medical knowledge and there were so many uncertainties and so many unknowns. She was deliberate in her remonstration; it was delivered in front of the medical teams. She wanted to bring everyone together, not divide them. As she put it to me, 'How will berating them help Sally? She needs everyone on her side right now. We all need to pull together.'

"Of course, not everyone was on the same side. There were agendas, some of which I still cannot get a grip on. Raphaella was increasingly secretive. She then put forward a plan for a battery of further tests. This time, there was to be no stone left unturned. The schedule was for it to last between five and eight hours. She came to me that evening at my house - I needed to get out of the hospital for a while and take a shower, get fresh clothes and just have a change of scenery. I'd just got out of the shower when the doorbell went. I let her in, water was still dripping off my hair. As soon as the door was closed she said, 'I have a plan, Melvin. It may save Sally's life. If you agree we will conduct surgery tomorrow during the tests.' She was so direct, it took me aback. I asked her, 'Surgery to do what, exactly?' She was evasive, 'To make you understand, I need you to meet someone.' She pulled out her phone and spoke into it, 'Please, come in Gray, come and meet Melvin.' Raphaella opened the door. There stood a young man, no a woman dressed as a young man. She smiled and came in. 'Melvin, we don't have much time. Sally does not have much time. Gray, please show him.'

"Gray turned her head. At the back was a short ponytail, she pulled it out and parted the hair. There, neatly was a silver-grey circle with a small domed insert, about an inch across at most. She tied her hair back up and say down in living room.  
    'This is a *Brain-Computer-Interface*, or BCI, some people call it a *Gate*, there are many words for it. Anyway, it connects directly to my brain. Through it I can connect directly to the Internet and to others with a similar device. We believe that such a device will help Sally, through it you will be able to communicate with her and she with you. She is locked-in, her body's senses have shut the world out, this device allows her means of getting out.'"

Melvin continued, "I was knocked back to be honest. I had read something about it, years ago, they had managed to reach patients who were thought brain dead and their families had been able to communicate with them again. I looked at Gray, I'd have never thought that someone as healthy as she obviously was would have such a thing implanted in their brains. My thoughts, though, were interrupted. Raphaella was pressing me.
    'We need your approval to proceed, Melvin. The risks are low. We have done this a number of times,' she said to me. I felt trapped and pressured, but what else could I do? Without some means of connecting to her, Sally was dead to the world. Questions tumbled out, I was confused and worried. 'What can she do with it? If she has the surgery, that is. Are you certain it will work?'
    'I can't say, Melvin. We are confident that the surgery will go well, as much as we can be. But if Sally will be helped by it? I'm sorry, we're in the dark on that. We think so, we hope so. It has worked with other patients, as I said. It's got to be worth the role of the dice though, no?'"

"So, I agreed. I had to. You see that, right?" Melvin pleaded, to understand. I felt at that moment, he wanted me to forgive him I guess. I looked at him sat on the comfortable leather chair opposite me, and he sank into it, and said to me, "Imagine utter sensory deprivation, Charles. Not like those fashionable tanks that allow you to float in a dark silence. This is utter. This is nothing. The only thing that exists is that which your own brain produces.

"In the void the brain does produce. It has to. Sensations drift across imagined limbs. An itch that can never be reached nor even fully identified where it comes from. A light flickers just out of sight; a rustle, a hiss just out of earshot. You are disembodied. You float with no concept of up or down, or front or back. The ghostly memories of your senses replay within the void, hinting at what maybe, was was and is now. The parts of your brain that think swiftest imagine threat and refuge. All that is real is self. Nothing but memories of what once was exists now. No new input to process. Nothing."

I struggled with this picture Melvin gave me. I could only make sense of it when recalling what Lia had told me, and her experience of the Gate-augmented connection: we never think of that deluge of data that floods our every waking moment; and even less of what it would be like without it. Our minds would crave essential nourishment and would wither and eventually die. Maybe not at an animal level, but the higher functions that make us, us; they would die surely, starved of the points of reference that maintain our conscious compass, we would drift away and diminish to nothing but our brute selves.

Melvin had spent more time on this philosophical problem than anyone, I'd imagine. He continued to explain, "Knowing that we are awake or asleep, is not something we often struggle with. There is enough information to tell us. Not for Sally then. First, when she woke and realised that she was awake, she must have been terrified. Then, over time, she understood what awake meant, I suppose. The initial twitching, itching, whispering glimmers that had so terrified her at first, would have faded. She then felt nothing. She felt no pain, no pleasure, no fear. She felt nothing at the idea of drifting away to nothing at all. Dreams," Melvin described, "were better to her then; waking had become just sleep. She could not remember being awake - nothing happened then. She knew she was awake; somehow she knew because there was nothing. When she dreamt at least stuff happened."

"You see, the doctors were so damning at that time. 'I am sorry. Things are not looking good. We are struggling to tell now whether she is asleep or awake. In fact, we think that the active periods are not when she is awake at all, but when she is asleep, dreaming. I'm sorry,' they'd said. And I would say, 'I understand.' But, I didn't really. In fact, I wasn't really listening any more. I already knew the truth that she was slipping away, I could feel it. That's why, when Raphaella DiCosta came to me, I just said yes. I didn't really hesitate. Christ, if the child died during the operation, well, that would have been better than her slow maddening demise in the dark. I didn't care what Joan said, or anyone else. Sally needed some *hope*!"

"What did Joan say, Melvin, when you told her," I asked him.  
"What do you think? She said no. I think it was because Joan already thought Sally was dead. She must have thought, 'what was the point?' Look, we didn't really talk about it. Not in any detail, that is. She hated Raphaella."
"Is that when you went behind her back?" I asked him.
"Yes," Melvin said. "Well, not really. I suppose we thought - I mean Raphaella and I - we assumed she would not allow it. So Raphaella came up with a plan to get it done anyway. We'd deal with the fallout afterwards.

"When we returned to the hospital. Raphaella came up called the medical teams together and ran through the plan for the tests. The five to eight hours was more than enough time to complete the surgery, she told me. Given time zone differences to California, the tests were going to start late at night, so the remote team could feed back any findings. The local team wasn't needed - they had day jobs and would better benefit from some sleep, she told them. Raphaella made it all sound so innocuous, so routine. I remember my heart hammering as she ran through it all; I was shaking. At my cue, I announced I wanted to be present. I remember Joan giving me what looked like a dirty look." Melvin, leaned back further into the sofa and drew a deep breath. He was reliving that moment and the nervousness of it was evident in his face. It was a huge gamble.

"So, tell me Melvin, you watched the operation. How is is done?" I asked him. You see, I was intrigued, no one really went into any detail with me. I suppose those I had spoken to about it were not conscious during the operation, so wouldn't know.

"Okay, this is what I saw," Melvin said. "They wheeled Sally into the MRI room, with all her paraphernalia. They parked a partition outside so no one could see in. It was late, but they took no chances," he explained. "They then wheeled in the usual operating materials and got right into it. Look, I didn't have the best view. I was at the back and the room was cramped, but I could see some of it, just not the detailed stuff, you know, the up-close work the surgeons did. There was a lot going on and I couldn't take it all in. They first turned Sally on her side and covered her, leaving only her head. One of the team then clipped away her hair in a wide circle, about a hand's width in diameter. The area was shaved to the skin and painted with iodine, or something else yellowy. I couldn't see the next bit, the surgeon was in the way. I could see at one point a tool being used, it looked like something you'd have in a wood-working shop. The surgeon stood back and I could see Sally's yellowish-pink brain, there in the open, a neat hole exposing it. Then, another person took over, who took a long while, with many items being passed to and fro. When they had finished the skull was back in place with a circular metal ring attached at the centre of the shaved area. You know, the same as Lia and Gray has. The first surgeon then returned to work and when he was done, it was finished. The skin had been pulled back up to the ring and it was all neatly stitched up. It looked neat work, from where I was stood. The second doctor then cleaned the area and placed a small domed object into the ring. A small blue light was flashing. They rolled back onto her back, resting her head carefully on a cradle, so the *Gate* was supported. They then rolled Sally out of the room and back into the ICU. It all seemed routine to them.

"I resumed my usual seat at that time, next to Sally's bed in the ICU. I was tired. I had stood there, watching the operation, for nearly four and a half hours. I dozed and was woken by Raphaella. She had a tablet in her hand. She seemed excited and it woke me up.
'This may take time,' she told me. 'She may not understand the signals. We are only going on what other candidates have found to work. No one was as young as she is.' I asked Raphaella, 'What do I do? She said, 'just type, a vocabulary of no more than 3 or 4 common words. Remember, short repeating words. Her name is a good idea: repeat it often,' she explained."

I interrupted Melvin. "It was then you were arrested?"
"No, not for a few hours. I sat there, typing words, over and over, trying to get through to Sally" he explained. "The nurses came and went, as they did. About mid-morning, one of them saw the cradle. She left and a while later a doctor, one of the local team, came in. He asked me about it. I told him. I told him everything. He left and I just carried on, tapping away, hoping for something. Then, just after lunchtime, three police officers knocked on the door of the ICU. They arrested me for child abuse."

So, that day, when he managed to get through to her, is not something we can easily imagine. Sally was on the brink of oblivion. "She thought she was asleep and dreaming," Melvin told me. "She was dreaming of letters. They had fallen across the dark then hung in space: meaningless. They had faded. Then they had reappeared. They had changed, but she did not understand. She said she felt tired and had drifted away to the memories of her body and senses of places and people past that were remade into new worlds for her to explore, in her dreams."
