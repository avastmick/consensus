# a glimmer in the dark

Without doubt, my few days with Melvin were amongst the most emotional of my life. I am sure I can only fail in conveying the turmoil that he and Sally's mother, Joan, had lived through over the last year or so. Even as I recall these meetings and the frank monologues that Melvin gave, I find my carrying shy of the real weight that burdened the man; I know I shrank from him as he unfolded his bleak story. It was too much for any person.

"Melvin was a tall man. I always think that being tall at an older age is unexpected; I do not know why. For his age, over seventy, he was healthy, slim and fit; he had that indescribable energy some people had, that seemed to ignite action in others. However, when he spoke of these times, of Sally's illness, he seemed to shrink in size and the spark of intensity, dimmed, as if the very words were hollowing him out.

"Melvin sat on a comfortable leather chair, he sank into it, and said to me, 'Imagine utter sensory deprivation. Not like those fashionable tanks that allow you to float in a dark silence. This is utter. This is nothing. The only thing that exists is that which your own brain produces.

"'In the void the brain does produce. It has to. Sensations drift across imagined limbs. An itch that can never be reached nor even fully identified where it comes from. A light flickers just out of sight; a rustle, a hiss just out of earshot. You are disembodied. You float with no concept of up or down, or front or back. The ghostly memories of your senses replay within the void, hinting at what maybe, was was and is now. The parts of your brain that think swiftest imagine threat and refuge. All that is real is self. Nothing but memories of what once was exists now. No new input to process. Nothing.'

"I struggled with this picture Melvin gave me. I could only make sense of it when recalling what Lia had told me, and her experience of the Gate-augmented connection: we never think of that deluge of data that floods our every waking moment; and even less of what it would be like without it. Our minds would crave essential nourishment and would wither and eventually die. Maybe not at an animal level, but the higher functions that make us, us; they would die surely, starved of the points of reference that maintain our conscious compass, we would drift away and diminish to nothing but our brute selves.

"Melvin had spent more time on this philosophical problem than anyone, I'd imagine. And, given my cowardice on the topic of Sally's plight I was shocked that he had pressed Sally on how it had felt, at first, before the Gate had given her those first drops of information.

"He told to me that Sally's only way to explain, was her measurement, somehow, of her condition, and whether she was asleep or awake. He said, 'knowing that we are awake or asleep, is not something we often struggle with. There is enough information to tell us. Not for Sally.' He continued, 'first, when she woke and realised that she was awake, she was terrified. Then, over time, she understood what awake meant. The initial twitching, itching, whispering glimmers that had so terrified her at first, had faded. She then felt nothing. She felt no pain, no pleasure, no fear. She felt nothing at the idea of drifting away to nothing at all.'

"'Dreams,' he said to me, 'were to her better then. Waking had become just sleep. She could not remember being awake: nothing happened there. She knew she was awake; somehow she knew because there was nothing. When she dreamt at least stuff happened,' she had told him.

"I am sorry. Things are not looking good. We are struggling now to tell whether she is asleep or awake. In fact we think that the active periods are not when she is awake at all, but when she is asleep, dreaming."
"I understand." He didn't really. He wasn't really listening. He already knew the truth that she was slipping away, he could feel it.
"I cannot imagine what it must be like for her. She has no stimuli. Her mind is completely closed."
"We have done everything, yes?" He stared at her. She felt his accusation.
"We cannot think of anything more. Before you say, it is not because of the risk. Either to her or us. I want this to work. I wanted it to work."
"I'll keep going. Thank you, for this." He held up the tablet.
"She may not understand the signals. We are only going on what other candidates have found to work. No one was as young as she is." Her lips tightened and she slowly shook her head. "I am so sorry." She caught herself and focussed on him. "Remember, short repeating words. A vocabulary of no more than 5 common words. Her name: repeat it often."

"So, that day, when he managed to get through to her, is not something we can easily imagine. Sally was on the brink of oblivion. 'She thought she was asleep and dreaming,' he told me. 'She was dreaming of letters. They had fallen across the dark then hung in space: meaningless. They had faded. Then they had reappeared. They had changed, but she did not understand. She said she felt tired and had drifted away to the memories of her body and senses of places and people past that were remade into new worlds for her to explore, in her dreams.' At this point, Melvin had got up and went to a draw in a dresser in the corner of the room, where we were sat. He came back with a blue card folder. He flicked through it and pulled out an A4 sheet of paper. 'This is Sally's description of our first words. I've never shown anyone else. So, rather than my clumsy attempt, here, read hers.' I took the paper and read the typed words.

Awake. I am sure. The black the utter black. The words. The words! They are words. If I think hard I can make them move. I am on the wrong side, or they are on the wrong side. I should be above them like when I read a book. No they have to be below me. I have to move them. I can read them if they were only below me and not above me. I am so tired. I am trying to move the letters. I have tried forâ€¦ I don't know. I want to try. I want to. I am so tired.

Asleep. No. I am awake. They are there still. They have changed, but they are still there. Yes lower, they are lower. They are still squashed and wrong. It is like they are on a window. I am on the wrong side. I need to be the other side. No they need to be on my side. I cannot move. They must move. I must move them. They are below me.

Still awake. So tired. So tired. They are now clear. I can read them. I don't know what to do. They are me. *sally*.  I know the words. My name. They begin to fade. No! No, no, no. Don't go! A light seeps across my words. They are gone. I can see a place, it is familiar. My heart sinks. The place fades away. I am asleep. I know that.

Awake! Yes I am. My letters are there. Below me, the window right side to me. New words.

*sally think of words to say*  

Yes I can do that. I can think of so many things to say. Grandad. It must be him. He is here. He is talking to me. Where is he? Is he trying to help me? I think of something to say. The harder I think the fainter his words become. No. Don't go grandad. Don't go. The more I think the less the words appear. I am so scared. I am so scared. Tired. I am so tired.

Awake. Words are still there.

*sally you can do this*

He is still here! I didn't make him go away. Grandad! Hello. Grandad! The words fade. His words, they fade. My words are there.

	*hello grandad*

I want his words. I have made words. Where are his?

	*hello sally*

	*grandad i am here*

	*i am here i will help you*

"When I finished reading the words on the paper, I went to give it back to him. 'She told me that the words aren't right, but I guess they are as close as we can through words. I have another version now, but I cannot share that, I'm sure you understand. You can keep it.'

"The paper would, in much different circumstances, have been cherished in the same way as a painting or a poem, maybe hung on a wall, or on the door of a refrigerator, as a work of imagination by a 10 year-old girl, I suppose it would be remarkable. As an artifact, a record of an actual event, it felt, to me at least, almost obscene to take away. It was a private thing that should not be shared. But Melvin was adamant. 'No, please, keep it. It is worth you thinking about it, as I did. Only then, maybe, can you understand what I was going through and she.'
