Our problems started with Sally Taylor. Everything had gone so well, to that point. We were making a good impact on social media and the general news was running a number of stories on Transhumanism, with our input. That, and with Lia, we felt we had real momentum. However, there is no defence against something like Sally; any progress we made, disolved in the face of that unfortunate ten year-old girl. How can you pick a fight with that? How can you attack the morals of a helpless, grieving mother? Or take to task a depairing grandfather? You cannot. Look, I know, I tried, but it gained me nothing; no, that's not correct - that fight cost me everything. And, let me be plain, Sally's story is remarkable too. Even I am moved by the sequence of events that led to our involvement.

"I met Melvin Taylor at his house just over a month ago. The street he lives on is the epitomy of surburban comfortable living; hence the name of the place, Surbiton, Surrey, England. It is lined, nose to tail, with nice, shiny cars, on either side. This does make the street feel narrow, but means that any traffic moves slowly. The pavement is wide and grows, at even intervals, plane trees. Melvins's home is a clean-bricked, three-story town house that stands mid-way along the street and has inviting yellow lights that spill from the windows, brightening the evening of the grey day when I visit.

"Inside it is warm. Thick colourful rugs cover bare wooden flooring. And it is on one, Melvin told me, that Sally, ten years-old, sat neatly cross-legged, her hands supporting her head, her elbows on her knees, on that day their life changed. They were playing chess, he recalls, and Sally, bright and quick, used to taunt Melvin, 'It's your go, grandad. You're sooo slow.' He told me, that he remembers every detail of that afternoon, as if he could access, on demand, a looped home movie in his mind. He had played this loop over and over, so many times, that he can recall every word, every gesture, as if they were happening right there, before him, right now.

"He remembers that the girl sighed, 'So slow. It will be dark and you said we were going to the park.' Melvin had slid a pawn one space forwards. 'There,' he had said, his hand hanging for a moment over the piece, hestitant. 'All that thinking for that!' Sally had giggled, then she leaned acutely from the hips, snatched up the hestitant pawn with one hand and slid her bishop onto its place with the other. 'Check!' She laughed. Melvin smiled at her, 'Ahh, now I have you.' Then he frowned a mock frown of deep thought. He remembers telling her, 'To save your embarassment, let's go to the park now. We can finish this game when we get back.' She teased back, 'Sure, grandad, because I am so going to lose. Let's go.' Melvin recalls just how she so easily lifted herself on the spot, her legs elegantly unfolding as she rose. And how she stretched and dashed off down the corridor, her dark hair bouncing across her back. He compared it to the way he had levered himself up into a seated position, picked up the chess board and placed it on the coffee table. How he had pushed up on one knee, and how he had creaked himself upright. Above all, how he had followed her happily.

"They had wrapped up warm that day, with coats and scarves and hats. Along the street was a narrow alleyway. They walked down it, Sally chatted constantly, Melvin only partially listening, but well enough, so any question thrown out could be answered. He remembers the serene smile he had upon his face as they walk. He recalls watching Sally skip and twist and jump alongside him. She had given him her energy that day. As he watched the movie loop, he often felt the urge to stop them, and send them back into the warm, he tells me.

"He continued, and after some time the alleyway ended at another street. The end of this street was open, with no houses. Naked trees pressed in towards a large black wrought-iron gate. It gave entry to a park beyond. They opened the gate and went in, he tells me. The gate had clanged behind them. Melvin recalls looking back at the gate. Sally had run off, jumping and swirling, her cheeks were pink in the cold air. Melvin crunched along the gravel path after her. Under the damp trees he could see his breath. They climbed, the zig-zagging path, up the park rise, towards the shiny silver sky of that winter's day.
At the top of the rise they stopped. Melvin sat on a bench. He remembers the view back across the city and the how the air was clear and sprawl of London stretched out before them: houses after houses. He said to her, 'Look at all those people, Sally!' Sally was stood behind him on the grass bank, her shoes wet and muddy. Vividly, he recalls that she was quiet now, for the first time that day. 'A lot of people, Sally, all chatting on, making noise,' he said, knowing she always bit at the bait of this comment. But Sally was still for a moment, staring towards something, her face pale. 'You okay, chicken?' And he remembers she was not, 'Can we go, I don't feel so good,' she had said. He had wanted to get her back in the warm and he had worried that her mother, Joan, would have been cross at getting her cold. He had stood up from the bench. And as he did so, Sally had slowly fallen. The knees of her woolen tights had sunk into the soft grass. Melvin remembers grasping her arms and lifting her onto her feet.

"Melvin recalls the walk back down the gravel path and how he held his grandaughter's hand gently as they went. He did not hold it hard enough though, as as they approached the gate, she stumbled and fell again. She had slipped from his grasp and had fallen heavily on her face. He can clearly hear the sound of her face crunching into the gravel, even now. He remembers her weight too as he had lifted her up so she can slump over his shoulder, his arms gripping beneath her legs. And, he can clearly feel the ache of his muscles as he had walked back to the house, Sally in his arms.

"Back at the house, she was brighter, chatting again, warming up. He had made her take off her muddy tights and put on warm pyjamas bottoms. He had made her hot chocolate. She looked better and his anxiety had ebbed. He had asked, 'Wanna finish the game? I feel bad though, as I'm going to beat you.' Sally had been defiant, 'Yeah, right. When did you last win a game, when I was like, eight?" It was she who had lifted the board back onto the floor. She had plopped down cross-legged in her usual manner, except she had tilted awkwardly. He can see now her hand going forward and landing in the middle of the board to catch herself. He can still see the chess pieces tumble. He can see himself standing there, staring at Sally. She had started to cry. She tried to pick the pieces up, but somehow her hands fumbled them and she knocked the remaining pieces across the board.

"As this scene plays in his mind, his heart always sinks to his stomach, he says to me. He remembers dropping to his knees next to her and holding her. 'It's okay, it's okay. You've got cold and your body is playing up. I've got you, Grandad's got you.' Sally had leaned into him and he had surrounded her with his arms.

"'Grandad's got you,' Melvin had said to Sally. He told me that those words echo in his head, over and over, 'Grandad's got you.' But he hadn't. She was sick, as we now all know. Something was very wrong with Sally, something very rare and strange.

Grandad is afraid for Sally. He speaks to his daughter who is afraid and defensive. Something is wrong.

More and more the girl's physical abilities are unpicked. She stumbles more and fumbles more and starts to mispronounce words more. Sally is sick. She is losing her motor functions and no one is sure why.

The doctors are damning in their prognosis. The mother falls apart, leaving only the grandfather to support and console the girl. Slowly she slips away, to be left locked-in with no evident external sign that she has anything left of the bright young girl she once was.

The mother starts to mourn and is angry at her father for his faith in his granddaughter. They fight and he has to use subterfuge to even continue to see the girl. The girl deteriorates and requires support to keep her alive. The doctors are convinced there is little hope of improvement; the mother strongly advocates turning it off. The grandfather is furious and seeks help, he is convinced that she is still in there.

A woman comes to him saying that she may be able to help. She describes how the a "Gate" may not only be used to connect to her, but that her deteriorating health may be helped by her reconnecting.

Note: trials with monkeys that when isolated fall into despair and their health fails them.

The grandfather works out a way of circumventing the mother and the Gate is inserted.

Sally has surgery to attach the Gate and it being powered up to connect. This fills in the detail from Lia's description. Melville is a much more fastidious narrator.

Nothing happens. The mother finds out and has him arrested. Hope is fading and the mother wants to have the Gate removed. The doctors warn that another surgery may be fatal. The woman secretly arranges for the Gate to remain connected by blackmailing the active consultant. She plays a text game with the girl to show how to communicate. Nothing.

The woman speaks with the grandfather, who is on bail. She says it looks like it has not worked at that the girl may not be able to understand how to interact. The grandfather presses and asks for access. She enables a remote means of text-based access.
