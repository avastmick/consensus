# Chapter 19 - Connection bonds

I hadn't seen Melvin for a couple of months, since I saw him with Joan. He hadn't called back when I had left messages. I'd even took the chance of 'dropping in' one day. It was a warm, late Spring day, I git out of the taxi some distance from his house and walked up. I banged on the door for an age. There was no one at home. No car was parked outside. The blinds in the front of the house were down.
    For a while I thought that my last meeting with Joan had finished any chance of further meetings. She had been angry with me. I had dug up the past and exposed the cold dirt. She hated me for it. It was that sort of calm anger that would burn for years, smouldering away, preventing any chance at forgiveness. Melvin's relationship with his daughter was not an easy one. They were too different emotionally for them to be close. She was emotional, a highly strung woman who responded immediately without any effort of thought or application of logic. Her father was the opposite. He was careful, at times even slow to respond to situations. His experience had taught him over the years that panic and quick response added nothing to the outcome. He told me that things that at first seem so important, so massively significant, later evaporate; they are non-events that fade quickly from people's minds if only allowed to do so. I hoped that Joan's anger would be treated by him like this. Who could guess the father's reaction to the pain of his daughter. It could be, of course, that now Sally's health had improved and her connectedness was now assured and familiar, Melvin was bored with forking over the ground with me. Nothing new would grow there, he may have been thinking, so why expend any more energy. I too had given up. I probably had enough, but it all seemed unfinished.

"Did you miss me, Charles?" Melvin's voice was his usual flat monotone. "I got your messages. I hadn't forgotten you. I was out of the country. How are you? Come and see me, man. We've still lots to discuss I think." Melvin had called me. I was relieved. He was right, I had missed him too. I missed his company. I had come to think of him as my friend.

"Let's go for a walk," he said when I got to his house the next day. "It's such a nice day. Too nice to be stuck inside listening to you twittering on about yourself." He laughed at me. We left the house and took the same route, he said, as he and Sally had that day she was taken ill. "Let's go to the park, come on." he walked quickly, with a spring in his step. He seemed excited and as if years had come off him.
