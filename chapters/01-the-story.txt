You know me. If you are unsure, if I say, Charles Godwin, do you know me now? Of course; you have come to know me, I'm certain, as the man who tried to stop the future. Words you would typically throw my way would be 'Luddite', 'bigot', 'manipulator', 'child hater', and many others that would not be suitable for a prime-time audience. But, may I ask that you put all of that to one side for a moment, and listen? Yes, I know what you are thinking, 'Why should I? Why should I waste my time listening to a man who was yesterday's news, a man who lacked moral substance, a man who dined out on the fears of others?' And you are right, I have been largely forgotten and, when I was called upon, I *was* found wanting. But I didn't know then what I know now. Surely, you are interested in that. You do not have the whole story.

I can tell it you now, the whole thing. Only by hearing it will you see that the events that occurred were not as they appeared. I was not the monster you think. No one was wearing the black hat in this story, nor anyone white, trust me on that. Nor is this story mine. Yes, I will be telling it, but the players will be themselves, those who were actually involved. You see, amazing as it sounds, these people all wanted to speak to me and tell me their side of things. I know, it is almost unbelievable. These people, most of whom I damaged and treated so badly, to a person wanted to see me and give their account. I guess, people love telling their story. I'd say it's in our DNA, part of our base code that makes us, us.

Interested yet? Surely you are. And what is in it for me? I'll be blunt. It is the same as it always has been. I haven't changed. But being yesterday's news pains me, not for myself, no, because the discussion I had instigated has dried up. My goal here is to engage with those, like you, who have become so disinterested. To reignite the most fundamental debate of our times. It is not too late. And still, deep down, I feel that what I had been fighting for then, was right; the very essence of it morally correct. I had lost an unfair and dirty fight, on both sides, but I maintain that I held the higher ground. But, I did lose. I was broken. Those close to me had evaporated in self-doubt, and the very things we'd been fighting for were no longer as clear and important. I had tried to fade back into the background. I kicked around a while, licking my wounds, feeling sorry for myself and struggling with how I could lift myself from the pit I found myself in. I was forgotten.

But now, I find, I am no longer alone. When I returned from that wilderness, lifted myself from that place, I still had connections. People of influence who would help get me back in front an audience, like yourselves. They believe in the importance of what I have to say. When you hear me, I am sure you will too. If you do not, well, you will wander into the future without a say, uninformed, without any influence over what it will hold, not just for you, but for all of us. So, sit down, settle in and relax. I will do all the work, trust me, flying across the globe, meeting with the antagonistic, confronting the dangerous, listening to the deranged and describing the fantastic.
