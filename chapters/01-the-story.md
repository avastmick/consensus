# Chapter 1 - The Story

I am Charles Godwin. I am old. I forget many things now. My mind is cloudy and uncertain. But I do remember the past. Those memories have a vitality that my decrepitude cannot diminish. That is why I enjoy the company of the young. They remind me of how I once was. For a time their questions lift the fog and I am renewed. Most often, they ask, "How did we come to live the way we do?" The answer takes me back, years ago, when I too was young and events made deep impressions on my mind. I remember, back then, it was touch and go whether we would all pull through. It could have all gone very badly. But, in the end it worked itself out. Sense prevailed, I suppose. People were allowed to do what they wanted to do, and each took their own path to where we are now - apart. We made our choices then and we live by them now. Some are not happy, of course. Their complaint is the same as has echoed through history. They ask, "Why should I suffer the sins of my father?" I cannot answer that. We are here. Compromises were made to avoid catastrophe.

We know where we are. That is not the question. It is how we got here, what were the events that led us to this point? Well, I could put together a complex, but convincing narrative, that would give you an answer, full of big themes and grandiose philosophy. I won't. All that stuff is rubbish, nothing more than propaganda, a victor's history. You see, there were no victors in all this; everyone lost something. I cannot go into the detail of it all; it is too complex. Instead, I will give you a simple story that was, to my mind, the start of it all. It is about a little girl who fell ill and nearly died. Some say, she did die and was resurrected. To those, she is a messiah, the catalyst to all the change we have gone through. She led them across the Rubicon, to a point from which there was no return.

Years ago, not long after I left university, I had read a lot about certain experiments being done. These things weren't being done for the sake of medical science, though many claimed they were. No, they were meddling with biology with the goal to make a new, improved human. The practitioners of this were called *Transhumanists* and they intended to change the world. They did.

I recall there was, briefly, a hand-wringing about all this - this tampering with the human body. These experiments, advances if you will, were in isolation no more than discomforting. Then they came together, each a piece of a larger puzzle, and they became something else. It was at that point I became terrified at the possibilities. Of course, we could have dealt with it all then, if we knew. We could have stopped it, snuffed it out before it spread. I even felt a simmering anxiousness in people at that time; I hoped it would boil over and be a tide to wash it all away. People, though they did not readily understand the threat's nature, felt its looming. Their reason to be, their work, their lives, was already being eroded by technology and automation. This new thing was to compound their woes and make them even less significant. They even lashed out for a while, demonstrating their angst, their malcontent. But they mistook their real enemy and instead struck at those more historically familiar to them. They marched and protested against globalisation, immigrants, religions even whole countries they'd never visited or knew little about. They became distracted by the wrong things and were re-enacting old battles long settled. That allowed sufficient time for all those disparate pieces to become whole and gather strength. As it did so, all the tensions and worries about what tomorrow may hold, seeped out of the public consciousness. It vanished from view as if a hidden hand had some influence in it. Of course, there was. It was a grand conspiracy.  I don't have the details now, but let me tell you, significant players of the time had a hand it. It was media suppression; there was a lot at stake for them. They weren't going to allow a public debate on what their money was spent on.

The rich of the time were willing to take the biggest of gambles - they lay their bets against the future of humanity. They desired to fiddle with the fabric of our being. They were arrogant, their intentions pure vanity. They wished to cheat death and make themselves immortal. They believed they could do a better job than the exquisite evolutionary engineering that produced us. They turned their backs on the millions of years of fine-tuning that made us who we were and what we had. We had, some of us still have, a vital spark, a bright light within us that shone out and threw back the dark of the world. No other creature had that, only we did, and it set us apart. These people would extinguish it through ignorance and hubris. 

To fight them I founded the *Human Association*. Its goal was to ensure humanity's future. We fought for the ordinary person; we fought for the likes of the young who now ask their questions. We failed. I fell hard too. My reputation was in pieces, but, I was never the monster many painted me to be. To paraphrase a dear friend of mine: No one wore a black hat in that story, nor anyone white. We were all to blame for what happened. 

And what did happen? I will tell you my small part. I remember it so clearly, even now. I will let the others involved all tell theirs. After the dust settled and I was ruined, I didn't give up.

And what is in it for me? Redemption. No one wants to live their life the villain. You see, I am not that. Being yesterday's news pains me too. Worse still was being held a laughing stock. Not for myself, no, but because the issue was so vital, yet had dried up. My goal was always to engage with those, like yourself, who were disinterested at first and show them the truth. I must reignite the most crucial debate of our times. It is not too late. See, deep down, what I had been fighting for then, was right; the very essence of it correct. I had lost what was an unfair and dirty fight, on both sides, but I maintain that I held the higher ground. But, I did lose. It left me broken. Those close to me evaporated in self-doubt, leaving me alone. And the very thing I'd been fighting for was no longer as clear. I kicked around a while, licking my wounds, feeling sorry for myself. I struggled with how I could lift myself from the pit I found myself in. I tried to fade back into the background. I hoped I was forgotten.

Luckily, I later found I was not alone. When I returned from the wilderness and lifted myself from that place, I found I still had connections. People of influence that would help get me back on my feet and in front of an audience like you. They are informed. They believe in the importance of what I have to say. When you hear me, I am sure you will too. If you do not, well, you will wander into the tomorrow without any say or influence over what it will hold. Who knows how the future will unfold? Who would want to meet it uninformed of its possibilities? 

The incredible things I spoke are frightening now. Look at the things people can already do. That is not science fiction becoming science fact. These are actual things people have been able to do since the first decade of this century. New prosthetic limbs that can be inserted directly into bones and moved by nerve impulses alone. They can even change them out for different activities, or even fashion's sake. Are you forgetful? Why not enhance your brain, to remember things for you when your mind is failing, or maybe just give yourself an advantage. You could have a device attached to your brains to directly interact with your computer - useful if you are a drone pilot in the military. The speed of advancement is breathtaking. All these parts have all now come together. They no longer just augment, they radically alter. The lawmakers and regulators cannot keep up. Some of this stuff resides on the outside of medical science, an ethically grey fringe that doesn't even have regulation. But people are queuing up for it, to be part of it, despite the huge risks.  The pieces now together, they are forged into something new. The result is terrifying. When you see the gross things being done, you will know what to do.
