# Chapter 1 - The story

'Bigot', 'luddite', 'child hater', 'narcissist', these words were thrown at me, along with many others not suitable for a prime-time audience. You may remember me. I am Charles Godwin. I founded the *Human Association*, set up to fight for a fair place in humanities' future. I was fighting for the ordinary person. I failed. I fell hard. I regret that I threw it all away in a moment of anger when I was under pressure. Even so, I was not the monster you think. To paraphrase a friend of mine: No one was wearing a black hat in this story, nor anyone white. We were all to blame for what happened. 

What did happen? That's what I am going to tell here. And, the people involved all wanted to tell me their side of things. It is almost unbelievable. These people, many of whom I damaged and treated so badly, to a person wanted to meet me and give their account. People love telling their story and creating a convincing narrative of their lives. I'd say it's in our DNA, part of our base code that makes us, us.

And what is in it for me? Redemption. No one wants to live their life the villain. You see, I am not that. Being yesterday's news pains me too, not for myself, no, but because the discussion I had instigated has dried up. My goal was always to engage with those, like yourself, who were so disinterested. I hope to reignite the most fundamental debate of our times. It is not too late. And still, deep down, I feel that what I had been fighting for then, was right; the very essence of it morally correct. I had lost what was an unfair and dirty fight, on both sides, but I maintain that I held the higher ground, morally. But, I did lose. It left me broken. Those close to me evaporated in self-doubt, leaving me alone. And the very thing I'd been fighting for was no longer as clear. I tried to fade back into the background. I kicked around a while, licking my wounds, feeling sorry for myself and struggling with how I could lift myself from the pit I found myself in. I hoped I was forgotten.

Luckily, I later found I was not alone. When I returned from the wilderness and lifted myself from that place, I found I still had connections. People of influence that would help get me back on my feet and in front an audience like you. They are informed. They believe in the importance of what I have to say. When you hear me, I am sure you will too. If you do not, well, you will wander into the future without any say or influence over what it will hold. Who knows how the future will unfold. Who would want to meet it uninformed of its possibilities?
