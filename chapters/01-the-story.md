# Chapter 1 - The Story

Years ago, not long after I left university, I read a lot about certain experiments being done. These things weren't being done for the sake of medical science, though many claimed it was, no, it was meddle with our biology and make a new, improved human. The practitioners of this were called *Transhumanists* and they intended to change the world.


 
there was, briefly, a discussion, hand-wringing about this all - this tampering with the human body. I had read about the incredible things happening, but in isolation, none of these was anything beyond discomforting. Then they came together, each a piece of a larger puzzle, and they became something else. It was at that point I became terrified. We could have dealt with it all then. We could have stopped it, snuffed it out before it spread. I even felt a simmering anxiousness in people at that time too; I hoped it would boil over and be a tide to wash it all away. People, though they did not readily understand the threat's nature, felt its looming. They even lashed out for a while, demonstrating their angst, their malcontent. But they mistook their real enemy and instead struck at those more historically familiar to them. They marched and protested against globalisation, immigrants, religions even whole countries they'd never visited or knew little about. Everyone became distracted by the wrong things and were re-enacting old battles long settled. That allowed sufficient time for all those disparate pieces to become whole and gather strength. As it did so, all the tensions and worries about what tomorrow may hold, seeped out of the public consciousness. It vanished from view as if a hidden hand had some influence in it. Was there a conspiracy? Of course, there was. I mean things don't just stop being issues, do they? I don't have the details, but let me tell you, significant players had a hand it. It was media suppression; there was a lot at stake for them. They weren't going to allow a public debate on what their money was spent on.

Do not fool yourself that what affects me, does not affect you; it affects us all. The big story of our times has been hidden from you. It has passed you by without you even noticing it. Don't worry, the real truth of it didn't dawn on me at first either. You need to know. There are people among us who are willing to take the biggest of gambles - they lay their bets against the future of humanity. They desire to fiddle with the fabric of our being. They are arrogant, their intentions pure vanity. They wish to cheat death and make themselves immortal. They believe they can do a better job than the exquisite evolutionary engineering that produced us. They turn their backs on the millions of years of fine-tuning that makes us who we are and what we have. We have a vital spark, a bright light within us that shines out and throws back the dark of the world. No other creature has that, only we do, and it sets us apart. These people will extinguish it through ignorance and hubris. They wish us all to return to the shadows. We must stop them, together.


You may not remember me; I too was suppressed. I am Charles Godwin. I founded the *Human Association*, set up to fight for a fair place in humanity's future. I was fighting for the ordinary person; I was fighting for the likes of you. I failed. I fell hard. I regret that I threw it all away in a moment of anger when I was under pressure. Even so, I was not the monster many thought me to be. To paraphrase a friend of mine: No one was wearing a black hat in this story, nor anyone white. We were all to blame for what happened. 

And what did happen? I will tell you my small part, and the let the others involved all tell theirs. It is incredible, but these people, many of whom I damaged and treated so badly, to a person wanted to meet me and give their account. People love telling their story and creating a convincing narrative of their lives. I'd say it's in our DNA, part of the base code that makes us, us.

And what is in it for me? Redemption. No one wants to live their life the villain. You see, I am not that. Being yesterday's news pains me too. Worse still was being held a laughing stock. Not for myself, no, but because the issue was so vital, yet had dried up. My goal was always to engage with those, like yourself, who were disinterested at first and show them the truth. I must reignite the most crucial debate of our times. It is not too late. See, deep down, what I had been fighting for then, was right; the very essence of it correct. I had lost what was an unfair and dirty fight, on both sides, but I maintain that I held the higher ground. But, I did lose. It left me broken. Those close to me evaporated in self-doubt, leaving me alone. And the very thing I'd been fighting for was no longer as clear. I kicked around a while, licking my wounds, feeling sorry for myself. I struggled with how I could lift myself from the pit I found myself in. I tried to fade back into the background. I hoped I was forgotten.

Luckily, I later found I was not alone. When I returned from the wilderness and lifted myself from that place, I found I still had connections. People of influence that would help get me back on my feet and in front of an audience like you. They are informed. They believe in the importance of what I have to say. When you hear me, I am sure you will too. If you do not, well, you will wander into the tomorrow without any say or influence over what it will hold. Who knows how the future will unfold? Who would want to meet it uninformed of its possibilities? 

The incredible things I spoke are frightening now. Look at the things people can already do. That is not science fiction becoming science fact. These are actual things people have been able to do since the first decade of this century. New prosthetic limbs that can be inserted directly into bones and moved by nerve impulses alone. They can even change them out for different activities, or even fashion's sake. Are you forgetful? Why not enhance your brain, to remember things for you when your mind is failing, or maybe just give yourself an advantage. You could have a device attached to your brains to directly interact with your computer - useful if you are a drone pilot in the military. The speed of advancement is breathtaking. All these parts have all now come together. They no longer just augment, they radically alter. The lawmakers and regulators cannot keep up. Some of this stuff resides on the outside of medical science, an ethically grey fringe that doesn't even have regulation. But people are queuing up for it, to be part of it, despite the huge risks.  The pieces now together, they are forged into something new. The result is terrifying. When you see the gross things being done, you will know what to do.
