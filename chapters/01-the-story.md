'Bigot', 'Luddite', 'child hater', 'narcissist', these words were thrown at me, along with many others not suitable for a prime-time audience. You may remember me. I am Charles Godwin. I founded the *Human Association*, set up to fight for a fair place in humanities' future. I was fighting for the ordinary person. I failed. I fell hard. I regret that I threw it all away in a moment of anger when I was under pressure. Even so, I was not the monster you think. To paraphrase a friend of mine: No one was wearing a black hat in this story, nor anyone white. We were all to blame for what happened. 

What did happen? Well, incredible as it sounds, the people involved all wanted to tell me their side of things. It is almost unbelievable. These people, many of whom I damaged and treated so badly, to a person wanted to see me and give their account. People love telling their story and creating a convincing narrative of their lives. I'd say it's in our DNA, part of our base code that makes us, us.

And what is in it for me? I'll be blunt: redemption. No one wants to live their life the villain. I am not that. While I haven't changed, being yesterday's news pains me, not for myself, no, because the discussion I had instigated has dried up. My goal was always to engage with those, like yourself, who have become so disinterested. I hope to reignite the most fundamental debate of our times. It is not too late. And still, deep down, I feel that what I had been fighting for then, was right; the very essence of it morally correct. I had lost an unfair and dirty fight, on both sides, but I maintain that I held the higher ground. But, I did lose. I left me broken. Those close to me had evaporated in self-doubt, leaving me alone. And the very things we'd been fighting for were no longer as clear. I had tried to fade back into the background. I kicked around a while, licking my wounds, feeling sorry for myself and struggling with how I could lift myself from the pit I found myself in. I was forgotten.

Now, I find, I am no longer alone. When I returned from that wilderness and lifted myself from that place, I found I still had connections. People of influence who would help get me back in front an audience, like yourselves. They believe in the importance of what I have to say. When you hear me, I am sure you will too. If you do not, well, you will wander into the future without a say, uninformed, without any influence over what it will hold, not just for you, but for all of us.
