# Chapter 1 - The Story

I am Charles Godwin. I am old. I forget many things now. My mind is cloudy and uncertain. But I do remember the past. Those memories have a vitality that my decrepitude cannot diminish. That is why I enjoy the company of the young. They remind me of how I once was. For a time their questions lift the fog and I am renewed. Most often, they ask, "How did we come to live the way we do?" The answer takes me back, years ago, when I too was young and events made deep impressions on my mind. I remember, back then, it was touch and go whether we would all pull through. It could have all ended then. Instead, everything worked itself out. Sense prevailed, I suppose. People were allowed to do what they wanted to do, and each took their own path to where we are now - apart. We made our choices then and we live by them now. Some are not happy, of course. Their complaint is the same as has echoed through history. They ask, "Why should I suffer the sins of my father?" I cannot answer that. We are here. Compromises were made to avoid catastrophe. 

We know where we are. That is not the question. It is how we got here, what were the events that led us to this point? Well, I could put together a complex, but convincing narrative, that would give you an answer, full of big themes and grandiose philosophy. I won't. All that stuff is rubbish, nothing more than propaganda, a victor's history. You see, there were no victors in all this; everyone lost something. I cannot go into the detail of it all; it is too complex. Instead, I will give you a simple story that was, to my mind, the start of it all. It is about a little girl who fell ill and nearly died. Some say, she did die and was resurrected. To those, she is a messiah, the catalyst to all the change we have gone through. She led them across the Rubicon, to a point from which there was no return.

Many years ago, not long after I left university, I had read a lot about certain experiments being done. These things weren't being done for the sake of medical science, though many claimed they were. No, they were meddling with biology with the goal to make a new, improved human. The practitioners of this were called *Transhumanists* and they intended to change the world. They did.

I recall there was, briefly, a hand-wringing about it - this tampering with the human body. These experiments, advances if you will, were in isolation no more than discomforting. Then they came together, each a piece of a larger puzzle. They then became something else. It was at that point I became terrified at the possibilities. Of course, we could have dealt with it all at that point, if we knew what would unfold. We could have stopped it, snuffed it out before it spread. I even felt a simmering anxiousness in people then; I hoped it would boil over and be a tide to wash it all away. Although they did not readily understand the threat's nature, they felt its looming. Their reason to be, their work, their lives, was already being eroded by technology and automation. This new thing was to compound their woes and make them even less significant. The people even lashed out for a while, demonstrating their angst, their malcontent. But they mistook their real enemy and instead struck at those more historically familiar to them. They marched and protested against globalisation, immigrants, religions even whole countries they'd never visited or knew little about. They became distracted by the wrong things and were re-enacting old battles long settled. That allowed sufficient time for all those disparate pieces to become whole and gather strength. As it did so, all the tensions and worries about what tomorrow may hold, seeped out of the public consciousness. The opportunity was lost. It vanished from view as if a hidden hand had some influence in it. Of course, there was. It was a grand conspiracy. I don't have the details now, but let me tell you, significant players of the time had a part in it. They suppressed the media and diverted people's attention elsewhere. There was a lot at stake for them, see. They weren't going to allow a public debate on what their money was spent on.

The rich of the time were willing to take the biggest of gambles - they lay their bets on the future of humanity. They desired to fiddle with the fabric of our being. They were arrogant and their intentions pure vanity. They wished to cheat death and make themselves immortal. They believed they could do a better job than the exquisite evolutionary engineering that produced us. They had turned their backs on millions of years of fine-tuning that made us who we were and what we had. We had, and some of us still have, a vital spark, a bright light within us that shone out and threw back the dark of the world. No other creature had that, only we did, and it set us apart. These people would extinguish it through ignorance and hubris. 

To fight them I founded the *Human Association*. Its goal was to ensure humanity's future. We fought for the ordinary person; we fought for the likes of the young who now ask their questions. We failed. I fell hard too. My reputation was in pieces, but, I was never the monster many painted me to be. To paraphrase a dear friend of mine: No one wore a black hat in that story, nor anyone white. We were all to blame for what happened. 

And what did happen? I will tell you my small part. I remember it so clearly, even now. I will let the others involved all tell theirs, through me. After the dust settled and I was ruined, I didn't give up. I sought out those I had struggled against to see if I could better understand their point of view. Their goals were a mystery to me. I also sought redemption. No one wants to live their life the villain. You see, I was not that. Being yesterday's news pained me too. Worse still was being held a laughing stock. I felt I must reignite the most crucial debate of our time. I thought it wasn't  too late. See, deep down, I believed what I had been fighting for then, was right; the very essence of it correct. I had lost what was an unfair and dirty fight, on both sides, but I maintained that I held the higher ground. 

Luckily, I later found I was not alone. When I returned from the wilderness and lifted myself from that place I had dug for myself, I found I still had connections. There were people of influence on my side who would help get me back on my feet and in front of an audience. They were informed. They believed in the importance of what I had to say.  

Of course, it was all too late. Look at the things people could already do. That was not science fiction, even then. These were things people had been able to do since the first decade of this century. Each was a part of the new order of things, each sounded innocuous enough. New prosthetic limbs that could be inserted directly into bones and moved by nerve impulses alone. Their owners could even change them out for different activities, or even fashion's sake. Were you forgetful? Why not enhance your brain, to remember things for you when your mind is failing; what a boost for the aged that would be! Or, if you like, you could have a device attached to your brain to interact with your computer - useful if you are a drone pilot in the military. The speed of advancement was breathtaking. All these parts came together too fast for people to grasp the possibilities of it all. Before anyone could even discuss it, individuals were not just augmented themselves, they were radically altered. The lawmakers and regulators couldn't keep up. Their heads were stuck in the sands of a past lost. They had no grasp of the effects of this stuff. It resided on the outside of medical science, at an ethically grey fringe that didn't have regulation. All the same, people were queuing up for it, to be part of it, despite the huge risks. The pieces now together, these early evangelists were forged into something new. 
 
I travelled a lot at that time. The story was spread across the globe, from New Zealand to Shanghai, from London to California. I met the people who made up this story so that I could tell it better from their point of view. The journey to tell the story had its own story I found out later. Even though the world later went through tumultuous times and mankind split apart, I have been never as alive as I was for the few years before. That was my time. That was when I some role to play. I was on the stage then. Later I would be in the audience like everyone else, my career done.
