description: | 
  In the near future technology will encroach upon our biology. People will change themselves into something new. In this future, a young girl falls mysteriously ill. Her mother and grandfather are desperate. Opposing forces circle, seeing her as an opportunity to further their cause. The options to save her life are stark and may leave her less than human.
