# meetings

This file describes which meetings Charles Godwin has, with whom and roughly what happens. 

Also, each entry will have a *TODO*.

## 1. Himself. The narrator's set-up

* need to add a location

## 2. Lia in New Zealand, 
recounting their first meeting (and betrayal in Shanghai)

## 3. Lia in New Zealand, 
recounting what happened to her in San Carlos, while working for Charles, and meeting with and working with the 'crackpots'
## 4. Melvin, in Surbiton, 
recounting what had happened to Sally initially, before she was locked-in.

* complete where she is slipping away
* where Raphaella comes to him
* Joan's reaction (the horror!)
* The *Gate* being fitted
* Melvin being arrested
* Only Melvin still believes, but there looks to be no hope

## 5. Again Melvin in Surbiton, 
recounting what happened to Sally once the *Gate* is inserted

* How he was on bail
* How he got the tablet from Raphaella
* How she was awake and Godwin's reaction to Sally's letter

## 6. Lia, New Zealand, 
recounting the continued story of what was unfolding in San Carlos

* Who were the *crackpots*?
* What was their philosophy and ideas
* Describe how stupid they all were, Lia included
* Tell how they were caught (like duh!)

## 7. Melvin, Surbiton, raining. 
Melvin describes the pain of seeing the connection to Sally working, then seeing that it is not nearly enough. Meanwhile he tells of Raphaella and is first reservations, reservations that were played out in the media.

* Restructure to show the pain and uncertainty
* Introduce the interview as Godwin inserting a transcript

## 8. Godwin, Surbiton,
starts discussing a floatation tank. Then Melvin, compares the tank with Sally. 

* Explain that he doesn't meet Joan here, he just refers to her, like the Gray usage at 10

## 9. Melvin, Surbiton, 
recounting with Godwin, the board representatives describing their concerns. Introduces Godwin into the narrative. Ends back with Sally and her progress, she can now see and hear people.

* Write the scene out
* Show how Godwin's version is slightly different from Melvin's (they agree to disagree on the details)
* Describe how Melvin felt when he left, the company was not important
* Melvin explains that he had no interest in technology. In fact the reason the company was successful was that they were never distracted by the tech. They focussed on simple solutions, at first delivered cheaply, and once big, as the least scary option.

## 10. Gray, no defined location (at that point), 
others, Susan, Kyle (phone) - all discussing Lia's demise.

* describe how Lia gets off
* elaborate how Lia holds information that could blow both Godwin and Bright Futures off the board, for good
* Expand Gray's description of Wellington

## 11. Godwin, no location, 
describing himself

## 12. Melvin, Surbiton, 
describing Sally, how the connections to her have brought her health. But Raphaella still pushes and pushes

* detail what it is that *Bright Futures* want
* Indicate Melvin's concern and helplessness - he feel *Bright Futures* are manipulating both Sally and himself, but what can he do? Sally is happier and healthier.
* He argues with Raphaella, warns her of Joan and Godwin's mob.
* Raphaella says she is conflicted too as she knows what Sally wants and needs, and as a medical practitioner, feels obliged to help...

## 13. Melvin, Surbiton, 
describing the day he loses the company. 

* CHARACTER PIVOT MOMENT
* He describes his wealth and how that has made him no longer care about the loss.
* He has a focus now that is no longer to do with building a business
* He is now thinking about how he can help those like Sally

## 14. Gray, in London, South bank. 
She describes the study at *Bright Futures* and how it unfolded

## 15. Gray, at Godwin's apartment, West London. 
Describes the study team and how they connected brain-to-brain

* TODO the sequence where the group of five could agree on what to do next, constantly, instantly without a meeting or words
* **MASSIVELY IMPORTANT**

## 16. Melvin and Joan, Surbiton, 
Joan describes, with Melvin's help how Sally can now see and through VR goggles, she could see her.

* The event unhinges Joan, need to describe Joan's philosophy of a controlling mother, how she has obviously lost control of her daughter.
* She understands that connecting moment is beautiful, but it is also too weird for her
* Add in a sequence where Godwin convinces Joan to meet him again

## 17. Joan, at her apartment in Chelsea, West London. 
Joan describes her visit to see her own mother, Vi. The sequence is manipulative and revisionist. Godwin sees that the truth is not as nice and neat - Joan is not just broken because her mother is a a mean old pantomime drunk.

* Add in some Godwin interventions, asking for detail
* Add in a ending commentary that links Joan back to Sally - the question we want of the reader is, "What life would Sally have had if the illness had not occurred?" The answer should be, not as nice as you would have thought. Particularly when Melvin dies.

## 18. Godwin, alone, 
recounts the *Interview*, a mirror of that given by Raphaella at 6
    
* flesh out the scene
* show his regret and his own vanity
* show how those near to him ran once the shit was hitting the fan
* show how alone he is
* end with social media, memes, twitter

## 19. Melvin, Surbiton. Present. 
The narrative catches up with the time. 

## 20. Lia, phone call to New Zealand. 
Old school connection. All of the radical tech love Lia once had is gone.

## 21. Godwin, his apartment, 
he is no longer the direct narrator. There is another narrative voice now and it describes him. Pompous, vain and undefeated. he is even irrational. "I'd rather die that have my body polluted with devices stuck into my head."
