# This is a test file

I use this file to test the output of *pandoc* and the markdown interpreter.

I use the following command:

```
pandoc -f markdown -t latex -o test.pdf --smart --toc test.md

```

This should give a viable PDF file to play with.

## Reported text

<!-- Taken from Chapter 7, also -->


>"Good evening all, I am Anna Gardiner, BBC medical correspondent, reporting from the Queens Square Hospital, here in London. With me is Raphaella DiCosta, Director of Outreach at Bright Futures Cybernetics, who are based in California. Bright Futures have provided the Taylor family support and provide the technology that allows Sally to communicate. Good evening, Raphaella." 

>"Good evening, Anna, I'm pleased to be here this evening."

>"So, let me ask the question we are all wanting to ask, how is Sally?"

>"Sally is doing well, Anna. It is early days, of course, and there is a lot we do not know yet, but all the early signs are good."

>"So as I understand it, that due to a recent illness, Sally had lost all motor functions and was until a week ago 'locked in' and could not communicate with anyone, is that correct?"
