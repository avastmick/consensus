  In the near future technology is encroaching on our biology. People are changing themselves into something new. Amidst it all is a young girl who falls mysteriously ill. Her mother and grandfather are desperate. Opposing forces circle, seeing her as an opportunity to further their cause. The options to save her life are stark and may leave her less than human.
