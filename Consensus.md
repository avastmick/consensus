# the story

So, who am I? I am Charles Godwin. And you have probably come to think of me some kind of bigoted dinosaur; a neo-Luddite out of step with the modern world; someone trying to take us all back to a past long gone. And, I know what some of you are thinking: 'Why would I even listen to a man who has caused all that grief and suffering.'

And I get that, I really do. That is why I ask for you hear my story. Only then may you see that the things that occurred were not as they first appeared. I am not the monster you think. No one is wearing the black hat in this story, nor anyone white, trust me on that. So, please, let me tell you my version of events.

As it happened, after the interview debacle, and the subsequent scandal, I was broken. Those close to me evaporated in self-doubt, and the very things we'd been fighting for seemed no longer as important. I tried to fade back into the background. I kicked around a while, in London, feeling sorry for myself, and licking my wounds.

Then, one day an idea came to me, a revelation, that I needed to get a better picture of what had happened, something with a different perspective. Recounting the story, truthfully, complete and without the baggage of bias held against me, by the media, would reignite the discussion that had dried up. This would, I hoped, engage again those who had become so disinterested in what was the most fundamental debate of our times. And still, deep down, I felt that what I had been fighting for was right; the very essence of it morally correct. I had lost an unfair and dirty fight, but I maintained that I held the higher ground - I still do. So, I thought, I would speak to all of the significant actors involved in the matter, if I could, and let them illustrate a richer, fuller story.

And interestingly, and to my great surprise, everyone agreed to meet me. Maybe, this is sign of the times we live in, where everything is shared. Or, I suppose, they thought I was beaten enough, and not to be a further threat. Sadly, that maybe more true than I could wish for.

I went first to see Lia. She had returned to New Zealand and picked up pretty much where we had first heard of her. She had returned to work as a software developer in the same multinational services company owner by Melvin Taylor. I have thought, that if events were to have played out differently, she may have been the poster girl to our cause: a young woman, talented enough and with real prospects to do well in life. She would have illustrated to the world what could go wrong with the transhuman dream, as she had lived it as a nightmare. I still believe that she has a compelling story to tell, but I don't think she's the one to tell it.

So, we were tipped off in July of last year of someone intent on the procedure - Lia - and that she had flown to Shanghai. It was her boyfriend, or ex-boyfriend I guess now, Kyle, that gave her away. He sent a private message the Twitter account @H+concerns that we were running at the time. He was worried about her; actually he was desperate. We said we'd help find her and give her any assistance we could, in return we were given the flight number, a fair few photos, as well as her usernames on social media accounts. This meant two things: one, that we had an opportunity to convince someone to work with us, someone who could help create problems for the transhumanists; and two, let the local authorities in China know about Dr Li and his involvement. I flew out the same week, with a couple of more technical collegues, Chris Neil and Susan Christien.

So we were in Shanghai. We had to follow, Lia to find Dr Li. We weren't spies, or agents of some hidden conspiracy as some reports have made us out to be; we were a small group of people that really believed in something; we were passionate amateurs.

We tracked Lia from the airport to her hotel. She was obviously very anxious, as you'd imagine. She was in a foreign country with no grasp of the language or culture; she was going to have a piece of metal and silicon surgically inserted into her skull by someone she'd never met. Following her was easier than we thought it would be, she seemed lost, wandering the streets of Shanghai. We were aided by the fact that the streets were not as busy as I expected, and that they had no obvious order. Riders on electric scooters ran, almost silently, in all directions, at speed. Bicycles, defying gravity, slowly wobbled past, avoiding the scooters and me. Taxis pushed through them all at an even pace, the bikes and scooters moving aside at the last possible moment. Lia walked more in the street than on the pavement; the small shops, selling everything from noodles to scooters to electrical parts, were all over the pavement. Bikes were parked on the pavement; scooters rode along it. But oddly, everything worked without drama, like those dances you can see in the evenings in the parks and side streets there, anyone can join but everyone knows the moves. We walked along, in almost plain sight, while Lia jumped from side to side, making herself unintentionally visible, making our job easier.

After a while, Lia had found a street sign that matched the paper she had grasped in her hand. This street was similarly lined with small shops, this time selling crockery, tea, fruit and haircuts; music blared out of the hairdressers, two hot looking young girls wearing bright pink sashes, stood to attention outside. Next to it, opposite a narrow alley, was an office with no obvious indication, to me anyway, of which business it was an office for. Above the door, 'Twelf', was written, and underneath, '12'. When I looked up I could see it was an office block, maybe 20 stories high. From my position, though I was uncertain if the offices were in use.
She went in. She told me that inside was empty. Opposite the door was this office desk on which sat this huge old CRT computer monitor with matching beige keyboard and mouse. It was like something from the nineteen-nineties. She told me she was thirty minutes early so she guessed noone was expected her.
In the corner was this other door, she said. When she opened the door, she saw it led downstairs, the stairs were well lit and clean so she went down. At the bottom was another door which was half-open, beyond a modern, newly renovated office that was clean and efficient looking. This is where she first met Dr Li.
Lia told me she was completely surprised by the clinic and its clean efficiency. In her mind was a vision of a rain-washed, crammed Asian city, a squalid, back street affair, where the surgery would be conducted under a naked light-bulb by a grubby man in a blood-stained white t-shirt. Whereas, it was not like that at all, and she had felt really relieved. Dr Li had said to her, 'It's not like Bladerunner, is it?' He had laughed, and said, 'it's okay, everyone thinks because this is China and we are doing sci-fi stuff, this must be like a sci-fi movie! This is Shanghai, it's a modern city.' Lia felt he was very proud of his city and that he just came across and genuine and likeable man.

So, the operation went fine. This woman showed up not long after Lia got there. She was the anaesthetist. Again she seemed very competent. They prepped her. Dr Li shaved a small area on the back of Lia's head where her crown was. They made her have a shower and put on a gown. They then took her into a small, clean room with a trolley-bed. She lay down on it. The woman gave her an injection and Lia slipped away with Dr Li holding her hand, saying soothing rubbish that she could no longer remember.

When she woke, her head hurt. A dragging, ache though, not a sharp pain. Lia asked Dr Li if everything went well. He told her, 'Of course, I've done this many times now.' He then turned and lifted up the hair at the back of his head. There was a Gate! Dr Li also had a Gate. This made Lia feel a lot better. She felt that to know the person who had just drilled a hole in her head and attached something to her brain had also had the same work done was comforting. 'Like getting a tattoo from someone with great tats', she said
Dr Li told her, 'It will ache for a couple of weeks and itch very bad for a month or more. But after a couple of months you won't notice it. You must try to keep it clean and don't bang it on anything. Sleeping will not be easy for a while.'

So, yes we could have dealt with Lia better. But you have to understand that she was an excellent opportunity for us. The Enhancers were dangerous, they could do things natural people could not. Lia was a tool for us to expose that.

We waiting for Lia back at the hotel. She did not leave her room for three or four days. The one day she left the hotel. She took a taxi, we almost lost her. We were saved by Susan, my colleague, having the speed of mind to ask the concierge where Lia went. She told him we were her friends and was supposed to meet her, but her phone must be flat or off. Luckily, the concierge went for Susan's story. He told us that she had gone to a bar. We jumped in a taxi and the unsuspecting man informed the driver of our destination.

It was one of those hipster beer bars. Lia told me that she was very much a craft beer fan and was missing home, so she went there on the consierge's recommendation. When we got there, I went into the back room conservatory area with Chris and left Susan to draw Lia out. Again we had some luck, apart from the serving staff, we four were the only people in the bar. Susan went over to Lia who was next to a fireplace that was hard to imagine being used, given the heat that day. Susan told Lia that her work collegues were in the back, and asked whether she wanted to join us. She did. It was as if Lia was almost desparate for company. We told her we were from a large technology company, in town trying to win some business; of course we couldn't tell her anything about it due to non-disclosure agreements and alike. She was animated and intrigued.

The beer helped too; as she relaxed we were able to encourage her to confide in us. We also let slip information about our business deal, all hush, hush, of course. Then, as if an imaginary line was crossed, she told us everything - why she was in Shanghai, what she had had done, everything. She told us too of her loneliness, of the her inability to connect to people, in having nothing to belong to. Before we knew it she was sobbing. We consoled her and told her we could help.

Over the course of the next week, we recruited her to our cause. She was learn how to better use her new ability by taking on a challenge. I told her, 'think of it like a training course, where the output was a working prototype, or proof of concept.' She could help us with our business mission and if successful could expect a decent payment, to make it worth her while. We told her that we were aware of a company that was developing an integration solution for the Gate that would enable it to allow better means of sensing sight and hearing, even touch. We set Lia to hack into Bright Futures Cybernetics and publish their research online.

 sally

"Our problems started with Sally Taylor. Everything had gone so well, to that point. We were making a good impact on social media and the general news was running a number of stories on Transhumanism, with our input. That, and with Lia, we felt we had real momentum. However, there is no defence against something like Sally; any progress we made, disolved in the face of that unfortunate ten year-old girl. How can you pick a fight with that? How can you attack the morals of a helpless, grieving mother? Or take to task a depairing grandfather? You cannot. Look, I know, I tried, but it gained me nothing; no, that's not correct - that fight cost me everything. And, let me be plain, Sally's story is remarkable too. Even I am moved by the sequence of events that led to our involvement.

"I met Melvin Taylor at his house just over a month ago. The street he lives on is the epitomy of surburban comfortable living; hence the name of the place, Surbiton, Surrey, England. It is lined, nose to tail, with nice, shiny cars, on either side. This does make the street feel narrow, but means that any traffic moves slowly. The pavement is wide and grows, at even intervals, plane trees. Melvins's home is a clean-bricked, three-story town house that stands mid-way along the street and has inviting yellow lights that spill from the windows, brightening the evening of the grey day when I visit.

"Inside it is warm. Thick colourful rugs cover bare wooden flooring. And it is on one, Melvin told me, that Sally, ten years-old, sat neatly cross-legged, her hands supporting her head, her elbows on her knees, on that day their life changed. They were playing chess, he recalls, and Sally, bright and quick, used to taunt Melvin, 'It's your go, grandad. You're sooo slow.' He told me, that he remembers every detail of that afternoon, as if he could access, on demand, a looped home movie in his mind. He had played this loop over and over, so many times, that he can recall every word, every gesture, as if they were happening right there, before him, right now.

"He remembers that the girl sighed, 'So slow. It will be dark and you said we were going to the park.' Melvin had slid a pawn one space forwards. 'There,' he had said, his hand hanging for a moment over the piece, hestitant. 'All that thinking for that!' Sally had giggled, then she leaned acutely from the hips, snatched up the hestitant pawn with one hand and slid her bishop onto its place with the other. 'Check!' She laughed. Melvin smiled at her, 'Ahh, now I have you.' Then he frowned a mock frown of deep thought. He remembers telling her, 'To save your embarassment, let's go to the park now. We can finish this game when we get back.' She teased back, 'Sure, grandad, because I am so going to lose. Let's go.' Melvin recalls just how she so easily lifted herself on the spot, her legs elegantly unfolding as she rose. And how she stretched and dashed off down the corridor, her dark hair bouncing across her back. He compared it to the way he had levered himself up into a seated position, picked up the chess board and placed it on the coffee table. How he had pushed up on one knee, and how he had creaked himself upright. Above all, how he had followed her happily.

"They had wrapped up warm that day, with coats and scarves and hats. Along the street was a narrow alleyway. They walked down it, Sally chatted constantly, Melvin only partially listening, but well enough, so any question thrown out could be answered. He remembers the serene smile he had upon his face as they walk. He recalls watching Sally skip and twist and jump alongside him. She had given him her energy that day. As he watched the movie loop, he often felt the urge to stop them, and send them back into the warm, he tells me.

"He continued, and after some time the alleyway ended at another street. The end of this street was open, with no houses. Naked trees pressed in towards a large black wrought-iron gate. It gave entry to a park beyond. They opened the gate and went in, he tells me. The gate had clanged behind them. Melvin recalls looking back at the gate. Sally had run off, jumping and swirling, her cheeks were pink in the cold air. Melvin crunched along the gravel path after her. Under the damp trees he could see his breath. They climbed, the zig-zagging path, up the park rise, towards the shiny silver sky of that winter's day.
At the top of the rise they stopped. Melvin sat on a bench. He remembers the view back across the city and the how the air was clear and sprawl of London stretched out before them: houses after houses. He said to her, 'Look at all those people, Sally!' Sally was stood behind him on the grass bank, her shoes wet and muddy. Vividly, he recalls that she was quiet now, for the first time that day. 'A lot of people, Sally, all chatting on, making noise,' he said, knowing she always bit at the bait of this comment. But Sally was still for a moment, staring towards something, her face pale. 'You okay, chicken?' And he remembers she was not, 'Can we go, I don't feel so good,' she had said. He had wanted to get her back in the warm and he had worried that her mother, Joan, would have been cross at getting her cold. He had stood up from the bench. And as he did so, Sally had slowly fallen. The knees of her woolen tights had sunk into the soft grass. Melvin remembers grasping her arms and lifting her onto her feet.

"Melvin recalls the walk back down the gravel path and how he held his grandaughter's hand gently as they went. He did not hold it hard enough though, as as they approached the gate, she stumbled and fell again. She had slipped from his grasp and had fallen heavily on her face. He can clearly hear the sound of her face crunching into the gravel, even now. He remembers her weight too as he had lifted her up so she can slump over his shoulder, his arms gripping beneath her legs. And, he can clearly feel the ache of his muscles as he had walked back to the house, Sally in his arms.

"Back at the house, she was brighter, chatting again, warming up. He had made her take off her muddy tights and put on warm pyjamas bottoms. He had made her hot chocolate. She looked better and his anxiety had ebbed. He had asked, 'Wanna finish the game? I feel bad though, as I'm going to beat you.' Sally had been defiant, 'Yeah, right. When did you last win a game, when I was like, eight?" It was she who had lifted the board back onto the floor. She had plopped down cross-legged in her usual manner, except she had tilted awkwardly. He can see now her hand going forward and landing in the middle of the board to catch herself. He can still see the chess pieces tumble. He can see himself standing there, staring at Sally. She had started to cry. She tried to pick the pieces up, but somehow her hands fumbled them and she knocked the remaining pieces across the board.

"As this scene plays in his mind, his heart always sinks to his stomach, he says to me. He remembers dropping to his knees next to her and holding her. 'It's okay, it's okay. You've got cold and your body is playing up. I've got you, Grandad's got you.' Sally had leaned into him and he had surrounded her with his arms.

"'Grandad's got you,' Melvin had said to Sally. He told me that those words echo in his head, over and over, 'Grandad's got you.' But he hadn't. She was sick, as we now all know. Something was very wrong with Sally, something very rare and strange.

Grandad is afraid for Sally. He speaks to his daughter who is afraid and defensive. Something is wrong.

More and more the girl's physical abilities are unpicked. She stumbles more and fumbles more and starts to mispronounce words more. Sally is sick. She is losing her motor functions and no one is sure why.

The doctors are damning in their prognosis. The mother falls apart, leaving only the grandfather to support and console the girl. Slowly she slips away, to be left locked-in with no evident external sign that she has anything left of the bright young girl she once was.

The mother starts to mourn and is angry at her father for his faith in his granddaughter. They fight and he has to use subterfuge to even continue to see the girl. The girl deteriorates and requires support to keep her alive. The doctors are convinced there is little hope of improvement; the mother strongly advocates turning it off. The grandfather is furious and seeks help, he is convinced that she is still in there.

A woman comes to him saying that she may be able to help. She describes how the a "Gate" may not only be used to connect to her, but that her deteriorating health may be helped by her reconnecting.

Note: trials with monkeys that when isolated fall into despair and their health fails them.

The grandfather works out a way of circumventing the mother and the Gate is inserted.

Sally has surgery to attach the Gate and it being powered up to connect. This fills in the detail from Lia's description. Melville is a much more fastidious narrator.

Nothing happens. The mother finds out and has him arrested. Hope is fading and the mother wants to have the Gate removed. The doctors warn that another surgery may be fatal. The woman secretly arranges for the Gate to remain connected by blackmailing the active consultant. She plays a text game with the girl to show how to communicate. Nothing.

The woman speaks with the grandfather, who is on bail. She says it looks like it has not worked at that the girl may not be able to understand how to interact. The grandfather presses and asks for access. She enables a remote means of text-based access.

 lia 2.0

"Sally's story is sad enough, on reflection, but I must go on. While the poor child's health was failing her, Lia was undertaking the task we had given her. I have to be honest at this point, I truly thought Lia could pull off her challenge. She started well enough. Within a week she had connected to a small group of software engineers at Bright Futures.

"Lia told me that this act of connection was an incredible experience; it is life-changing and shows to you clearly, for the first time, the exceptional power of our minds. It was almost drug-like, as she put it, 'like that first line of cocaine but immediate, or when something has gone wrong and your body dumps out adrenalin and thumps it through your body: you feel widely awake, hyper-alert and your brain seems to be going much faster than it ever has. And you would, someone else's brain is sending yours huge amount of data in a format that is native to you. Your mind doesn't need to process anything, there is no need for translation, or sorting; it is an instant insertion of feeling, thought and information, all wrapped together in one big hit.'

"But, this feeling quickly ebbs away so you cannot reach it, she said. The information shared doesn't stay, it washes in, then out of your mind, like a retreating tide; this is the natural  way of dealing with the vast amounts of data we processes each moment. That constant stream that flows into our brains, even without a Gate: the images our eyes see; the sounds our ears hear; the smells we breathe; the tastes we ingest; the sensations of touch, of hot or cold, of weight, of wind. An ceaseless deluge floods our brains each second and remarkably, it makes sense of it all, without a conscious thought. It translates it, sorts it, even augments it where it is lacking, and then stores what it thinks it needs and drains what it does not.

"Lia had to quickly learn how to keep a connection alive and contain the data given to her. It was tiring work and many days she just lay in bed and shut off her Gate's connection to exhausted to connect again. She felt it must be like, learning to uplift your senses if one had failed, say if you were blinded and you needed to train your senses of hearing and touch to compensate for the loss.

"The people she was connecting with, too, were tiring for her. These were peripheral personnel of Bright Futures, not, as we had hoped Gate engineers working on the integration software. They tended the corporate websites; they were not actors in the goals of the enterprise, but only held supporting roles. Also, they were, to Lia, unpleasant people. Invariably they were zealots, true believers of the transhuman aims of Bright Future.

"To Lia, she told me, her experience of Enhancers was no different from those she knew and connected to naturally. They were petty and simplistic and treated Lia like a child, deflecting her probing questions and challenging discussion with patronising trivia. They told her of their ideas of a super race of humans, more capable, more intelligent; they told her they were chosen people. Even Lia saw this as a laughably familiar set of concepts, played out by the countless hangers-on of visionaries and crackpots.

Need to have a set of characters in this group and their personalities

...

Detail the interaction and the hacking of the systems into Bright Futures. The 'crackpots' have extreme views that Godwin wants to publicise. They do no, however, represent the Enhancer movement; nor does Bright Future either. They are more into making money and finding influence - very Old Days, really.

Ends with her in a situation that she would never have allowed wanted. She is now the instrument of others' will and she cannot see a way out. She is frightened and alone.



 a glimmer in the dark

"Without doubt, my few days with Melvin were amongst the most emotional of my life. I am sure I can only fail in conveying the turmoil that he and Sally's mother, Joan, had lived through over the last year or so. Even as I recall these meetings and the frank monologues that Melvin gave, I find my carrying shy of the real weight that burdened the man; I know I shrank from him as he unfolded his bleak story. It was too much for any person.

"Melvin was a tall man. I always think that being tall at an older age is unexpected; I do not know why. For his age, over seventy, he was healthy, slim and fit; he had that indescribable energy some people had, that seemed to ignite action in others. However, when he spoke of these times, of Sally's illness, he seemed to shrink in size and the spark of intensity, dimmed, as if the very words were hollowing him out.

"Melvin sat on a comfortable leather chair, he sank into it, and said to me, 'Imagine utter sensory deprivation. Not like those fashionable tanks that allow you to float in a dark silence. This is utter. This is nothing. The only thing that exists is that which your own brain produces.

"'In the void the brain does produce. It has to. Sensations drift across imagined limbs. An itch that can never be reached nor even fully identified where it comes from. A light flickers just out of sight; a rustle, a hiss just out of earshot. You are disembodied. You float with no concept of up or down, or front or back. The ghostly memories of your senses replay within the void, hinting at what maybe, was was and is now. The parts of your brain that think swiftest imagine threat and refuge. All that is real is self. Nothing but memories of what once was exists now. No new input to process. Nothing.'

"I struggled with this picture Melvin gave me. I could only make sense of it when recalling what Lia had told me, and her experience of the Gate-augmented connection: we never think of that deluge of data that floods our every waking moment; and even less of what it would be like without it. Our minds would crave essential nourishment and would wither and eventually die. Maybe not at an animal level, but the higher functions that make us, us; they would die surely, starved of the points of reference that maintain our conscious compass, we would drift away and diminish to nothing but our brute selves.

"Melvin had spent more time on this philosophical problem than anyone, I'd imagine. And, given my cowardice on the topic of Sally's plight I was shocked that he had pressed Sally on how it had felt, at first, before the Gate had given her those first drops of information.

"He told to me that Sally's only way to explain, was her measurement, somehow, of her condition, and whether she was asleep or awake. He said, 'knowing that we are awake or asleep, is not something we often struggle with. There is enough information to tell us. Not for Sally.' He continued, 'first, when she woke and realised that she was awake, she was terrified. Then, over time, she understood what awake meant. The initial twitching, itching, whispering glimmers that had so terrified her at first, had faded. She then felt nothing. She felt no pain, no pleasure, no fear. She felt nothing at the idea of drifting away to nothing at all.'

"'Dreams,' he said to me, 'were to her better then. Waking had become just sleep. She could not remember being awake: nothing happened there. She knew she was awake; somehow she knew because there was nothing. When she dreamt at least stuff happened,' she had told him.

"I am sorry. Things are not looking good. We are struggling now to tell whether she is asleep or awake. In fact we think that the active periods are not when she is awake at all, but when she is asleep, dreaming."
"I understand." He didn't really. He wasn't really listening. He already knew the truth that she was slipping away, he could feel it.
"I cannot imagine what it must be like for her. She has no stimuli. Her mind is completely closed."
"We have done everything, yes?" He stared at her. She felt his accusation.
"We cannot think of anything more. Before you say, it is not because of the risk. Either to her or us. I want this to work. I wanted it to work."
"I'll keep going. Thank you, for this." He held up the tablet.
"She may not understand the signals. We are only going on what other candidates have found to work. No one was as young as she is." Her lips tightened and she slowly shook her head. "I am so sorry." She caught herself and focussed on him. "Remember, short repeating words. A vocabulary of no more than 5 common words. Her name: repeat it often."

"So, that day, when he managed to get through to her, is not something we can easily imagine. Sally was on the brink of oblivion. 'She thought she was asleep and dreaming,' he told me. 'She was dreaming of letters. They had fallen across the dark then hung in space: meaningless. They had faded. Then they had reappeared. They had changed, but she did not understand. She said she felt tired and had drifted away to the memories of her body and senses of places and people past that were remade into new worlds for her to explore, in her dreams.' At this point, Melvin had got up and went to a draw in a dresser in the corner of the room, where we were sat. He came back with a blue card folder. He flicked through it and pulled out an A4 sheet of paper. 'This is Sally's description of our first words. I've never shown anyone else. So, rather than my clumsy attempt, here, read hers.' I took the paper and read the typed words.

Awake. I am sure. The black the utter black. The words. The words! They are words. If I think hard I can make them move. I am on the wrong side, or they are on the wrong side. I should be above them like when I read a book. No they have to be below me. I have to move them. I can read them if they were only below me and not above me. I am so tired. I am trying to move the letters. I have tried for… I don't know. I want to try. I want to. I am so tired.

Asleep. No. I am awake. They are there still. They have changed, but they are still there. Yes lower, they are lower. They are still squashed and wrong. It is like they are on a window. I am on the wrong side. I need to be the other side. No they need to be on my side. I cannot move. They must move. I must move them. They are below me.

Still awake. So tired. So tired. They are now clear. I can read them. I don't know what to do. They are me. *sally*.  I know the words. My name. They begin to fade. No! No, no, no. Don't go! A light seeps across my words. They are gone. I can see a place, it is familiar. My heart sinks. The place fades away. I am asleep. I know that.

Awake! Yes I am. My letters are there. Below me, the window right side to me. New words.

*sally think of words to say*  

Yes I can do that. I can think of so many things to say. Grandad. It must be him. He is here. He is talking to me. Where is he? Is he trying to help me? I think of something to say. The harder I think the fainter his words become. No. Don't go grandad. Don't go. The more I think the less the words appear. I am so scared. I am so scared. Tired. I am so tired.

Awake. Words are still there.

*sally you can do this*

He is still here! I didn't make him go away. Grandad! Hello. Grandad! The words fade. His words, they fade. My words are there.

	*hello grandad*

I want his words. I have made words. Where are his?

	*hello sally*

	*grandad i am here*

	*i am here i will help you*

"When I finished reading the words on the paper, I went to give it back to him. 'She told me that the words aren't right, but I guess they are as close as we can through words. I have another version now, but I cannot share that, I'm sure you understand. You can keep it.'

"The paper would, in much different circumstances, have been cherished in the same way as a painting or a poem, maybe hung on a wall, or on the door of a refrigerator, as a work of imagination by a 10 year-old girl, I suppose it would be remarkable. As an artifact, a record of an actual event, it felt, to me at least, almost obscene to take away. It was a private thing that should not be shared. But Melvin was adamant. 'No, please, keep it. It is worth you thinking about it, as I did. Only then, maybe, can you understand what I was going through and she.'

 we are all of us responsible

In Wellington, I met with Lia in a number of locations. A favourite was a hipster cafe on Cuba Street. We never met anywhere that was not a neutral venue. I never learnt where she lived. Our conversations that stretched over a week had none of the intimacy of sharing that my sessions with Melvin had. She had no trust me. She still felt vulnerable to me I assume.

We discussed, on the third occasion, again in the cafe, when her life fell apart. This was a hard session as she squarely blamed the outcome on me. I of course refute this as misdirecting the truth. In fact, by the point where she because at risk, she was no longer of any significant use to me or those I was working with. She had already shared the nature of some of the people in the Bright Futures organisation, and had gathered evidence of their started extremism. This was more than enough mud for us to sling and make the media and people at large question Bright Future's goals.

But, Lia carried on, digging; worse for her was that she had connected fully with the crackpots she had got the information from and about.

It was as if she had enjoyed the thrill of the covert activities she was undertaking. She worked for them and against them.

They consisted of six people. [Names] Four of which had worked directly at Bright Futures, the other two indirectly. They had taken on a self-appointed role of disrupting the flow of information about Bright Futures reaching a wider audience. They also wanted to stop some of the investigations that were in flight on the technology.

...

Once the story broke it left Lia in peril. Her name was included in the list of perpetrators. She was wanted by the American authorities. She manages to get back into New Zealand using a British passport and lies low, avoiding the police,

the security of the company she was trying to attack and by those who coerced her into it.

Ends with Lia turning off her Gate; her mind quietens and the mass of input fades to nothing.

 one can't live on words alone

I was raining heavily the next time I went to see Melvin. The bare trees on the street outside now had fat buds that were waiting for the warmth of the sun. None was coming that morning. The sky was almost black. Lights were on in every house on the street. Cars had their headlights on. The rain bounced up from the pavement soaking my shoes and trouser bottoms even though I was well covered with a vast blue golf umbrella. They were so wet that Melvin insisted I remove them to dry; so I sat on the leather sofa in pyjama bottoms a hand-length too long and wearing slippers a size too small.

He told me that the initial joy and emotion of being able to connect to Sally had quickly faded. He said, "the messages from Sally were a deluge of questions and conversation; she never seemed to sleep, it was as if they were to stop they may never start again. I was exhausted, but if I stopped for any reason, she would be angry and upset. Joan just did not have the stamina required, either in staying connected or in the quality of communication. Sally was often mean to her mother and had mocked her for being 'stupid' on more than one occasion. The media were also now interested. At first Joan and I tried hard to keep them at bay, but we were worn down at the edges."

It was Raphaella's idea to have Bright Futures hold a press conference. I have included the transcript here, rather than being accused of giving it any spin. I don't need to; it was gold to us. I couldn't have paid for a better outcome, and those few minutes, in addition to Lia's information, now had Bright Futures painted as a shady organisation that no one should trust.

"Good evening all, I am Anna Gardiner, BBC medical correspondent, reporting from the Queens Square Hospital, here in London. With me is Raphaella DiCosta, Director of Outreach at Bright Futures Cybernetics, who are based in California. Bright Futures have provided the Taylor family support and provide the technology that allows Sally to communicate. Good evening, Raphaella."
"Good evening, Anna, I'm pleased to be here this evening."
"So, let me ask the question we are all wanting to ask, how is Sally?"
"Sally is doing well, Anna. It is early days, of course, and there is a lot we do not know yet, but all the early signs are good."
"So as I understand it, that due to a recent illness, Sally had lost all motor functions and was until a week ago 'locked in' and could not communicate with anyone, is that correct?"
"Yes, as far as we know, and I'd like to say there is a lot that we still don't know, Sally had some form of viral attack to her nervous system that left her conscious mind entirely disconnected. Unlike other cases of Locked-in Syndrome, which is probably the best definition we have for her condition we have right now, Sally not only has no motor function, but has no sensory inputs into her brain - so no sight, hearing, smell, touch or taste. This means that she is entirely cut off."
"How did your team know that Sally was, in fact, still alive? I understand both the family and the medical team here had largely given up hope for her."
"We have been monitoring cases of locked-in syndrome and of persistent vegetative state. In many cases the patients are conscious, they just have no means of expressing it to outside world. In some cases, they can even look dead. Time is important with all these cases. We have found that the longer the patients are in this disconnected state, the less likely there is of reaching them. In Sally's case her situation is particularly severe and it was vital we got to her as quickly as possible. Luckily, the technique we use in analysing the MRI data clearly showed that Sally was conscious. We got to her early and we were successful in connecting to her"
"And this is what the operation was for: to give her a means of connecting to the outside world?"
"Yes, we attached a neuroprosthetic device to Sally. This device allows for a computer to be in direct communication with Sally's brain."
"So, a device was surgically attached to her brain, we understand it is called a 'Gate', and this 'Gate' allows her to communicate with the outside word via computer. This is correct, yes?"
"Yes. Well, we do not refer to the neuroprosthetic as a 'Gate'. In fact, if I may say, that name maybe owned by another organisation. Actually, we do not have a term for the device, it is a brain-computer-interface, or 'BCI', another term used is 'cortical modem'. The device directly interfaces to neurons in Sally's brain and interprets the signals they produce. At present Sally can communicate using text. She is in almost constant contact with her mother and grandfather, as well as myself and my assistant, Kate Long."
"How long will Sally have to communicate through the device?"
"We do not know the answer to that, Anne. Not with any complete certainty. Unfortunately, both the team here and our own specialists do believe that the damage to Sally's nervous system is so great, it is unlikely she will ever recover."
"So she will only be able to communicate through a computer, for the rest of her life. Is that correct?"
"As I said, we do not know what the future holds, but for the time being that is the case, yes."
"Does this raise any ethical questions, Ms DiCosta?"
"Anne, I'm sorry I don't follow. What do you mean by ethical?"
"Sally is 10 years-old. What quality of life is she to have? I'm sure that some people may see Sally's future as bleak, terrifying even."
"Sally is alive, Anne. Bright Futures' technology has given her hope. I am uncertain: who would think that keeping her alive is a bad thing? Who knows what we may learn from this."
"So, you're seeing Sally as an experiment, then?"
"Not at all. We hope to help Sally gain a means of interaction with the world that will provide her with a good degree of quality of life later on. And, yes, along the way we will learn things that I hope will expand our understanding of how the brain works and how we can better interact with it."
"This technology gives hope to other locked-in or persistent vegetative state patients is what you saying, yes?"
"I think we need to be cautious about making any bold claims at this time. We are not looking to widen this trial to other patients."
"That does contradict you earlier statement somewhat. You stated that Bright Futures monitored other patients."
"We are monitoring, but not looking to widen our usage of the device at this time. We are focussing on improving Sally's quality of life."
"Quality of life, you say. I understand that even her mother feels that Sally has no quality of life. She cannot be touched, or held, things felt by most as vital to any quality of life."
"As I said, we hope to improve her situation over time."
"And you do not intend to use Sally as a guinea pig to further develop your technology?"
"As I said, I really do not understand the purpose of your current questions, Anne."
"Bright Futures has not leaked their technology to allow regulated usage by an underground transhuman movement?"
"No, Anne. We have been made aware that there are people who are connecting devices to themselves, but Bright Futures is not involved, in any way."
"And Bright Futures is not developing military solutions?"
"I'm sorry Anne, I thought this interview was about what we are doing to help Sally and her family. We are way off topic here."
"So you are not answering the question, Ms DiCosta?"
"No we are not."
"Thank you for your time Ms DiCosta."

Poor Raphaella, she had really dropped the ball. And we just picked it up and ran with it. We ignited discussion of the interview through social media. People love conspiracy theories, they love the idea that there are clandestine forces at work. They'd rather believe that than face their own truths.

The morning I went to see Melvin on that rainy day, I did a strange thing. For me anyway. I went to visit a flotation therapy clinic in West London. Their sales pitch was to provide people a refuge from the stresses of daily life and float in these tanks, listening to whale-song. Actually, it wasn't like that. It was a hyper-modern clinic staffed by beautiful people in immaculately tailored white tunic suits. One led me into a room. It was so white that my eyes struggled to focus on the details in the bright light. With the door closed, it was silent. In the centre was a huge white pod, smooth and curved like a marble pebble, shaped like a semi-flattened egg. I undressed and put my jarringly non-white clothes in a cabinet. I pressed a button and the pod opened. It was full of water, subtly lit with a blue light. I got in. The water was strangely neither warm or cold. It was not there. I closed the lid. I saw the light in the room go out as the lid closed. I put in some ear plugs and stretched out. I floated. The light dimmed and went out.  It was black. The water was salty. I could hear my blood pumping. I relaxed and I could hear my heart slow. My thoughts were vivid. I thought of Sally Taylor while I floated there.

As deprived of normal sensations as I was, I was nowhere near how Sally must have felt. I could feel my tongue in my mouth, moving. I could tense my thighs or my buttocks and feel the water move across my skin. I could feel my breath enter and leave my nostrils. I could hear the organic machinery of my body. I could sense my living self.

Sally, Melvin told me, could feel nothing. Even there, in that pod, huge amounts of data was flowing into my brain via my heightened senses. She was cut off from even these few senses. She had none.

Melvin had brought me to see Sally later that day. She just lay there, grey-skinned, lifeless, supported only by machines, fed through a tube, her waste collecting in a bag. She lies there still, she will never move from that place. The room is brightly painted and there are flowers and well-wishers' cards on the surfaces by the window. The medical machinery that surrounded her made her look to me shrunken in size, even though Melvin said she was a tall girl for a ten-year old and two or three inches shy of my five feet ten. There was no life in that room, it was more a crypt with Sally's body mummified remains. The rain was still pouring outside and the sky was dark.Melvin and I each sat in a chair on either side of Sally's bed. He spoke quietly as if not to rouse her. I had to lean in to hear him clearly. I watched her chest rise and fall in time to a bellows that rose and fell within a glass cylinder. "Those early text-based communications were harrowing," he said. "She described to us the black space she lived in. The only stimulation she received was the messages that come through the Gate. If the words stopped there was nothing left: a void without echo. It terrified us as it must have terrified her. Sally's mother found it very hard."

I couldn't fathom the despair of that place. I was, and still am, also terrified of looking into its possibility. I think because of that I can sympathise with Joan Taylor, Sally's mother.

I went to see her the following day. She lived in an elegant apartment in Chelsea. She was angry when she heard Melvin had taken me to see Sally. "Was she awake?" She demanded of me. I told her that Melvin had said she was sleeping. I had noticed the camera over her head. "He has no idea that man. I bet she was awake. She has done that to me. Kids love to snoop, and Sally is no different. She pretends to be asleep, but is listening or just watching you. As I said, she does it to me all the time."

The bright paint on the walls, the flowers, the cards, they made sense now. Of course!

I coaxed a reluctant Joan back to the time before, when there was only text communication with her daughter. She told me that the initial joy she felt at sharing words with Sally only briefly lifted her from her previous despair. "What kind of existence was it? What was she, a little girl or a machine?" She is still troubled by what Sally was, she told me.

"I have to tell you Charles, I don't think I was ever happy about what happened to Sally. I know, I know, what mother could wish their child dead. But I had mourned. I had begun grieving for her when my father had been convinced by that woman to let Sally have that operation. I was furious. I had him arrested. I hated him!" Joan fell silent often for long periods when we had met. It was as if she was searching for the right words, words that could describe the indescribable struggle of a mother losing her child. She had lost her physically to the virus; she had lost her mind to Melvin and the machines they attached her to.

"No. My baby girl has gone. I still have a daughter, but she is not the child I brought into the world. Not the girl I raised and loved. That girl has gone, and I am hated for it, saying what I feel. I can see it in their eyes, in the way they speak. At best they pity me. I know my own father does that, pity me." She fell back into another reverie. I waited.

"That woman had come to one day," Joan suddenly said. "You know that manipulative bitch DiCosta. She had managed to convince my father to attach her to the Internet, so she can have more to do, more to seek, something to distract her from her, how did she say it? Her 'predicament'." Joan laughed, a hard, bitter laugh. "I mean now she could watch YouTube all day instead of speaking to her 'stupid' mother! It did mean I got some sleep though." Sally's mothers face was hard and thin and constantly a slight tension played across her lips and nose, as if she was hurting in some way. It did mean she looked at you as if you were beneath her. She looked a snob. Though I saw nothing that made her one. It was just a look on her face.

"DiCosta was then all excited. Her Internet experiment was a big hit with Sally. But she didn't want to stop there. She wanted to conduct more surgery on Sally. I said no. Actually I said over my dead body. But Dad was keen on the idea. I still think he was fucking that woman. Had to be. He was like her puppy. It was repulsive." She paused again, but this time as if regaining her wind for a final push. To get it all out.

"So, I had an idea. Or I thought I did. I said they should ask Sally what she wanted. 'We should all stop making decisions for her without even asking if she wanted them,' I told them. So they did. She was nuts for it. The brat knew more about the options than we did." She laughed again, this time there was tenderness in it. "She was remarkably  well informed, she knew what she wanted. She wanted sight and hearing." Joan's voice cracked and her eyes pooled, wet and she sucked in air across her teeth. "She told me, she wanted a hug from me and be able to feel it."

A single tear broke the banks of her one eye and she pushed across her cheek and away with the back of her index finger.

Grandfather is asked to a meeting by a set of representative of the board of his company. They are accompanied by a man who says nothing, but introduced as Mr. Godwin. The board are concerned about the publicity the granddaughter's treatment is receiving. Grandad doesn't understand. What has that got to do with them, or anyone else! Mr Godwin asks Grandad whether he feels his granddaughter is still his granddaughter, or whether he is creating something that is just trying to recover her lost memory. Grandfather explodes in fury and storms from the meeting.

Ends with the little girl being able to see the feed from a video camera.

 the past is before us

I have to say that speaking of Lia is not easy. Not in the way that speaking of Sally is hard, but that Lia is a closed book, all I have and had is the cover, and that gives no more than a rough precis of of the contents.

There is no trust - ah that word again. The world seems to lack trust, or rather a sound reputation that is built up over time, takes only a moment to break. It is a fragile thing but it supports everything we do. Sorry I ramble for a moment. But, this idea is important to understanding Lia. She had no trust in me, even from the earliest point, even when we first met. But she trusted some more than others. She trusted some, Susan for example had Lia's trust. Personally, I find that incredible, that she trusted a person whose only interaction was to sell her out. Susan was my instrument to convince Lia to take up our cause. Yet here we are, nearly two years on from that first betrayal, and still Lia confides in Susan. In fact she arranged for me to go to New Zealand and see Lia. If I had asked I know she wouldn't have even responded.

Susan has seen the inside Lia. As has Gray. Why she lets these people who have no better a history of care than I do is a mystery. Anyway it is what it is. At least they are less shy to share; both Susan and Gray have given me a fuller understanding of the inner Lia and I would ever have got from her directly, given the circumstances. So, I am afraid we must do with third-hand understanding. For all that technology and direct connectedness, we are still stuck at an account given by a third-party witness. And you? Well, you are, what, fourth-hand? And even then, the account you receive is compounded: Lia to Susan, Lia to me, Lia to Gray; Susan to me, Gray to me; me to me; me to you. how much Lia is really in my account, and how much is actually just bits of me, and bit of Susan, and bit of Gray, all mixed together in a Lia-like form. Anyway, as I said, I'd be honest, or as honest as I can be aware of, so you can make your own judgement on the truth of things.

After the authorities let her go, she was seen as a champion of the truth. By many she was seen like an Edward Snowden, an insider who blew the whistle on actions that were unconscionable. But like Snowden, even after the consensus was that his actions brought, on balance, a positive effect, Lia found herself alone. She was not trusted by anyone, she thought at least. The likes of Kyle felt she was lost to them, beyond them, those she connected to felt betrayed, those she helped, like Susan, knew her fragility and could not embrace her further to their cause. She could not contribute or belong to any group without the fear she would break, from them and herself apart. She could not commit herself to anything concrete in case she shattered apart again and could not gather herself together.

So, she found herself in a small, damp apartment, near the hospital in Wellington, a run down area of the city. She had withdrawn, relying on takeout food and refusing the outside world that judged her. The flat had no viable Internet connection. She had no phone. She had fully unplugged. She hoped, at this time, that disconnected she was invisible and that the world that came to her, when her Gate was open, would vanish and never return.

She was depressed and lonely, Gray had told me. Yet, for all that, she was taking no responsibility for what she had done. It was the fault of others. Others like myself, or Susan, or Kyle, or Bright Futures. Gray had gone to see her. She explained, "Lia was useful, even though no one really believed anything thing she said. And, I have always had a bit of me that wanted to rescue people.

"Kyle gave her up," Gray continued, "as easily as asking him, 'Have you seen Lia? I need to see her, do you know where she is living?' He just told me, straight out. Maybe he thought I was from the 'authorities', or I was dangerous, but he never even asked who I was.

"So, I had her address and just went there. I wasn't sure what I was going to say, or even why I was going to see her. I knocked on the door. There was no reply, I banged louder, still nothing, so I was just about to leave and give up, when I heard Lia say, close to the other side of the door, 'Who is it?'.

"I told her it was me. I said it was okay. Lia slowly opened the door. It was just a crack, wide enough to just see her one eye, dark and sunken. I asked her, 'You letting me in?', and she said 'Sure.' and she stepped back slowly and opened the the door just enough for me to slide in. She pushed the door shut hard and as she turned away back into the room, I just grasped her shoulder hard and spun her to face me. I pulled her to me and held her. I could feel all the tension in Kia's body leave her and she slumped against my neck. She sobbed."

I pressed Gray as to why she went there, there must have been something in her mind. She said, "I guess I felt that we'd let Lia down somehow. It was an Old Days thing, we had just let her fend for herself and let chance shape the outcome. I was an idealist, that is why a had Gated-up: I wanted a better society where we were less at the mercy of chance, or the whims of the say-so of a few. We were now armed with a means of consistent and constant communication. So what happened to Lia shouldn't have happened, she shouldn't have just slipped through the net so easily. She had made a choice to join a better world, she'd taken a risk to do so, paid a lot of money, and pretty much ended up where she had started, alone. So, yeah, I guess I wanted to make it right.

"Dr Li, before he'd vanished, told us Lia was connected. He told us that she didn't have clue. We were just too slow. You, Godwin, you and your goons got to her first. Still she taught us lesson, a hard lesson. No one gets connected now without support. The free-for-all, Wild West, days of enhancing is drawing to an end. If people want in, we can help them, we had procedures and policies in place now. And Lia was the catalyst. So, all in I owed her, we all owed her.

"So, we had a bit of a cuddle and when she stopped sobbing, I sat her down. Asked her how she felt, asked her how she was coping, and all that." I said to Gray that she didn't sound too concerned. She said, "I was, I was just not good at that caring and sharing shit, I'm a practical lady. So I sat her down and shared some truths with her.

"I said to her, 'You felt that initial buzz of connection, you know that immediacy of information, the vividness of interacting with another person without the barriers. That can never be sated, you'll always want to revist that initial high.' She nodded at me. 'It is like doing drugs, see, cocaine or heroin or whatever, it's never as good as the first time, because it never surprises you again the same way. Drugs are great and all, I've always had a confortable relationship with them.' I told her. 'But connected is not the same. Sure it can be addictive and hey, it may even be as bad for your health, but drugs, you just sit back and they take you for a ride. Being connected, that empowers you. You sit back, nothing happens; you get involved it is as sweet a high as I've ever had. You're connected sister. You're never pulling that Gate out. You're always going to wonder if you can ever have that shocking thrill of your first connection again. And you can, you just need the right shit and the right people to share with. But most importantly, you need to get involved.'

"She just sat there, so I went on. 'You see, I think you just carried on your life the same after you were connected. You don't give yourself to the connection. You filter, you control and you just lie. That's the same way of living as lived, before the Gate is connected. You met Dr Li, yes?' She nodded. 'When he connected to you, he gave you access to everything. That calm you had after connecting with him was complete trust. He was open to you, and you could tell he had hidden nothing from you. He shared with me that you had no opened up, that you were just push-pull - that's what we call it when people just use there Gate to simply send and receive data - you have no emotional content with the data, you push-pull and don't just let people poke around in there and get to know you. Andrews, and those other crackpots at Bright Futures you buddied-up with, they're the same. For all their extremist bullshit and creating a new race of super-humans! Idiots. They are just the same, just with some clever hardware that allows them to think their half-witted thoughts to others, instead of making the effort of speaking them. Sorry Lia, I'm telling you it as it is. I'm sorry for what happened and that Godwin's mob got to you before we could, but I'm not so sure you were ever in the right place to open up as you needed to, as we all have.

"So, I laid it out on the table. Lia needed to get her Gate back online and start opening herself up. Only then, I told her, would she get to the point that she had hoped to reach when when she decided to have the gate implanted in the first place. I tell her to connect to me and just let it flow. But she just sat there and started to cry again. 'I can't Gray, I am so afraid of what is in my head, of what you will think if you see it.' I asked her, 'What do you have crazy mad thoughts of killing me or something?' She said, 'No, I want to have good thoughts, smart ideas and kind feelings. But, I just have stupid thoughts, mean feelings and dumb ideas. I'm not the person I want to be and I just don't want people to see that.'

"So there it was. The girl was vain and proud. Too much, so to let others in to poke about. She wanted to be loved, but was too afraid to let others love her for what she was. She hated the fact she was fairly ordinary and this hate stopped her from doing anything interesting. She was just a kid, and she didn't see that to grow up and become the person she wanted to be she had to take the pain caused by the truths given by other people.

"I asked again, but she was too upset to do anything. I left her. She was just sat on the end of that bed in that grubby and damp apartment. I gave it a go." Gray broke off and sat there staring at me. Then she said, "I wish you were connected, Charles. I wish you could feel what you had done, to her and to the others. I wish we could see you for what you are. Because sat here, looking at you, guessing what is going on in that fucking head of yours, makes me hate you and think that you are a fucking asshole."

I ducked the assault. I asked her why Lia was important. "She's not. She's no different from anyone. I you hadn't have fucked her up, she's be a no one. She'd probably just gone back to New Zealand, gone back to that shitty job and used her Gate to improve her twitch while gaming. But you did fuck her up, we hadn't done anything to help her. Then she had that brief moment of celebrity. It makes her a person of interest, as they say. She is a monster of your making, Godwin, your pawn and you pushed her too far up the board, so now she's too dangerous to leave alone."

 mr godwin


I'll get back to Gray later; she's important. But, I think at this point I urgently need to let you know more about myself. As you can see, I'm not pulling any punches here, when I tell you how people talk about me. But, to avoid burning myself in front of you and you cheering, at least let me make me human enough in your eyes so you turn your head away as the flames lick at me.

I am American by birth, but lived most of my life in Britain. I was educated there. My parents were rich and I can't say that any point in my life has been materially hard. I had an expensive education, which gives you, in Britain at least, two things: a general air of superiority and good connections. It also gave me the knowledge that an education of the kind I had allows many of the recipients to achieve things they otherwise would not. I saw a TV programme not long ago, if I am correct it was while I was in New Zealand. It showed abandoned dogs being trained to do all manner of things. It was amazing what they got these mutts to do, one could even drive a car, I kid you not! My point, though, is with enough time and with good training even a dog can do clever looking things. This is similar to an expensively bought education - it trains people to attain all manner of impressive achievements. Luckily, I was always smart, so, that training was well worth my parent's money. They would have been satisfied with their investment, I think, were it not that they are dead. They died diving in the Caribbean. My mother decided to use the cheapest diving company she could find and they asphyxiated while looking at an artificial reef, a sunken container ship, off the coast of Trinidad. I was twelve. When I was told I didn't cry. Later that day I picked a fight, something I had never done before, or since. My lack of familiarity with fighting showed and the boy, I think reluctantly, gave me a decent hiding. Later that week I stole a watch and fountain pen from a teacher. They were pretty nice and expensive. I wasn't really sure what I was going to do with them, and I panicked when we were told our stuff would be searched for them. So I hid them in the boy's dorm trunk while he was at the detention he received for thumping me. His family were not too wealthy. He never went on those school trips abroad, like skiing. He was expelled. The following term I was on the school ski trip, the one the boy never went on because his parents couldn't afford it. I shared a birthday with another boy and in previous years we'd had a party, with cake and sweets and presents all sent to our lodge. It was arranged by our mothers and had become competitive, with cakes getting bigger and the presents more expensive each year. That year the other boy had won.

So what, you say. See, I didn't mean for that boy to beat me up, it wasn't a plot to gain sympathy or attention. I just picked the fight with him because I was angry my parents had died. I felt bad when he got the detention. Neither did I mean to steal the watch and pen. I saw them during gym. They looked nice. I didn't have a nice pen or watch. I don't know what I was thinking. I did panic when I heard they were going to search the dorms. The boy's trunk was unattended and you could get there without anyone seeing. See, I picked a fight with the boy at random and chose his trunk because he was unlucky enough to have a bed in a place I could not be seen by others in the dorm, and he was in detention. I didn't mean for it to happen. I didn't set out to get him expelled. And even that wouldn't have happened if his parents were rich and not always late with paying the fees. He was unlucky. I met him years later in bar in London. When I saw him my heart sank to my feet. There he was, I felt I'd ruined his life or something, and there he was, looking over at me. So I just went over to him and I came clean to him. I have to admit, I was fully expecting a second beating. But he just laughed. He said he hated it at that school, 'Full of snobs and dimwits,' he said. He only stuck it out because his parents made such sacrifices to send him there. Instead, he went to the local grammar school and went on annual skiing trips with his parents with the money they saved. The local school was good, and he did well. He became a lawyer and was then a partner in a pretty big financial law firm. He was doing alright.

See, I was involved, but not to blame. Even if I was to blame, and given I was twelve and the extent of my guilt is limited, even if I was, what would I be to blame for? Stealing the watch? Getting the boy expelled? Making him happier when he left? Causing him to go on skiing holidays? I am not ashamed of things I have done. Why should I be? I have never set out to harm anyone. I cannot always predict what is going to happen when I do something. Also, the people I warred with, as I have said, none of them are without blame either. All have made their choices and their mistakes. And, Sally Taylor, she is like me and that boy at school. She's twelve now. She's made decisions, remarkable as that seems. Is she to blame for anything?

 the joy of text is overrated

Sally is improving rapidly. Her body's health responds to the nourishment her mind is being provided.

"Her improvement is remarkable. We can clearly see her mental states now - whether she is awake or asleep or whether she is sleeping. I am so happy for you."
Grandad looked at her hard, "Happy for yourself too, no doubt. She's your ultimate saleswoman. She wants more and more. I'm afraid of where it will go. Her mother is so conflicted."
"I don't understand. What option do you have? You're happy with how she is? You're happy with her just surfing the Internet all day and watching videos of the world about her. She wants interaction. She is smart and has worked it out. If she is stuck physically as she is, she will never be able to live any sort of fulfilled life. She wants more than to be able to message people. She wants to see them directly and that they see her."

 consensus 1.0


"I'm sorry. The vote was unanimous. The board feel that there is too close a relationship between the recovery of Sally and the business of the company. There are rumours that you used company resources and employees to help with the integration of Sally to the Internet."
"The code used is open source. There are a couple of dev labs that specialise in this stuff. They helped."
"That's illegal."
"No it is not. The act of an unlicensed use of a Gate is illegal, or rather the person installing the Gate is operating outside of the law. The law says nothing about software or the person receiving the Gate."
"It's a shady area. So you are saying that no employees were used?"
"Not to my knowledge."
"Come on, that's a convienient line."
"I can't control what employees do in their own time by their own volition."
"Their contracts do. They are clear on working outside of the company while in our employ."
"Look, you want me gone - fine. You try to get me out to save money and try and not pay me outâ?¦ It won't end well. Sally is very public you know. I can't imagine shareholders liking that story."
"Okay, let's not go there. Listen, let's get to the real point. There are some on the board who want to know about your relationship with Bright Future."
"BFC provided the Gate and the technical team that implanted it into Sally. They provided a consultant ///woman who assisted in connecting to Sally. They're good, professional. I trust them as I know what they want and why they put forward so much resource."
"You aren't involved with their business?"
"No, I guess I am their customer."
"You paid for their assistance?"
"No, as I said, it's pretty clear why they'd help. The publicity alone is worth whatever I could pay them. They're looking pretty good right now."
"That's the problem. Some on the board and certain large shareholders are not happy about this..."
"You mean that Godwin clown."
"Among others."
"Look I'm a pretty straightforward businessman. I don't get the issue. We produce software and sell software services. We're doing well. I can't see that Sally's story will affect that; there's such thing as bad publicity, as they say. And BFC are in no way an issue, they are not a competitor. Not even remotely. Sorry, you say let's get to the real point. You're not. Come on say what you've been sent to say."
"This isn't about business, it's about morals. Many on the board and many shareholders have expressed clearly they think you've overstepped a line."
"You're fucking kidding me? I've overstepped a moral line to save the life of my granddaughter? What the fuck?"
"Have you saved her life? Or have you done something else? We tried to warn you last time we met. You've been used by an organisation to further their agenda. They used your daughter to have a story about how humankind can now cheat death."
"What I'm playing God. Oh for fucks sake, *really*? This is due to some religious nutjobs who own our stock. You think BFC used me? They saved my granddaughter!"
"Not BFC, Bright Future, the parent organisation. They are pushing a transhuman agenda. You've given them the ultimate trojan horse."
"Get out. Just get the fuck out. You've gone fucking insane. Pay me off, otherwise this will be spilled across the media and you'll be a fucking laughing stock."
"Will we? Not a lot of people like the idea of transhumanism. People don't like change. People won't like at all the idea that this change is against everything they've ever known."

 consensus 2.0


When I first met Gray, I thought there had been a mistake. She looked eighteen, well no, a young man of eighteen, or at least, not a thirty-something woman. I held the same misjudged assumption as others, that is that she is transgender. "Nope." She is striking to look at. Well muscled and wearing, usually, tight manly clothing, she looks the picture of the dream butch lesbian, I guess. She denies that. "I like fucking men. I like working out. I hate dresses." She is slightly aggressive in body language and invasive of the usual norms of personal space. Her face, though, is calm, not friendly, but her words are invariably warm and pleasant, and littered with expletives. She is highly capable and intelligent. I think she revels in her ambiguous personality. She doesn't want to fit in and doesn't want others to put in a particular box, either. Gray is an interesting woman. She sees the world differently.

"Hey, be happy with what you are," she told me, "you wanna be straight, fine with me; you wanna be gay, yep go to it. Just don't ask me to conform to either or neither. Okay? And, you're not my type", she smirked at me. The way she said was like a challenge. "Now Melvin, you know him, he's definitely my type", she purred at me. "It's the power thing he has, we all love a bit of being told what's best for us on occasion. He still looks fit enough to give a lady a good workout." She laughed, her eyes fixed on mine. I had to laugh too.

It was a warm day I met her. The South Bank was busy with tourists and office workers taking the scenic route. Gray was in black jeans and a tight white t-shirt that didn't quite meet the belt line. Her dark hair was pulled back into a short, stubby ponytail. She wore big nineteen-fifties style sunglasses. On her feet were dainty black and white pumps. She said she was keen to meet me again, when I emailed her. Her response had come back instantly; at first I thought it was an out of office notification. But, it was a fairly long and considered response to my questions. I didn't think she would meet me.

Gray and Melvin both gave me more time than I expected, or I deserved. Lia was closed and hard to speak to, that was no surprise, given what I guess the consensus was, that it was all my fault. Melvin had lost the most, materially, but it didn't seem to be an issue he dwelt on. I put this down to the fact he was wealthy enough not to care about the financial loss - he had 'fuck-you' money - and that his predominant focus was on the care of his granddaughter. Now, Gray, she really surprised me. I was the ENEMY. She was fully invested in the the idea of transhumanism. She was not a silly girl who thought this was cool. To her it was the only hope for the human race. She felt that what had got people to this point will not get to us to where we want to go.

As she put it, "The tools - the hardware and software if you like - that we developed on the African plains we all originally came from, have not changed. Sure, we've created a great set of external tools, but we have not changed the way we work. And the evidence points to the fact that our brains are competent in radical changes. Look, rats in labs have learnt to use magnetic fields to 'see' when they were wired to use a neuroprosthetic geomagnetic sensor. The brain is not hardwired, it is plastic, moldable stuff that adapts. Look at Sally Taylor, none of the stuff she's doing is hardwired in her brain. She's learnt how to do it, some consciously, some sub-consciously."

As she spoke to penny dropped, I got it. Yes, I was the enemy, I stood at the other side of argument, but woman was an evangelist. It was obvious now I met her. She wanted to convert me to her cause! I asked her, "So do you all work for Bright Futures?" She shook her head and sat down on a bench overlooking the river.

"No, in fact I know very few people within the movement that do. Don't get me wrong they definitely make things easier for us when they can, but they are a corporation, their goal is to sell the neuroprosthetics they develop, and as it stands any chance they have over even getting close to a profit is years away, possibly decades." She smiled at me, "Especially with people like you to deal with, Charles." The sun caught the buildings of the City of London opposite, glaring back at us. "Like people everywhere, we are a varied bunch. We have those, like Lia, wannabees, who think maybe it's cool; then there's the idiots, like Rob Andrews, who think they are uber mensch, probably with delusions of world domination or similar; there are the techs, like Dr Li who are committed to the concepts, but just want to make the transition as easy and risk free as possible; and us. I guess there will be more like Sally too, but we don't know we these people will go; and we have no children yet, those who know nothing else but being connected." Gray stared out across the river, towards the glare of the City.

I looked at her, I could see the metallic glint of the Gate beneath her ponytail. I said, "We are afraid of you, Gray. People do not like change. And they like being an individual and your goals are to remove the individual. Much of what you see here," and I swept my hand along the river bank as if lifting up the City beyond, "this came from the the ideas of individuals, bright sparks. I know that once that is lost only mediocrity is left, tired conformance, producing nothing new."

"I am an individual," she said. "No one in the collective makes me conform. Do I look conformist? The thing that people miss when they are spinning up their terror towards us, is that the concept they really object to, 'the hive mind', already exists. Hello, it's called civilisation people!" She yelled that out, people stared at us for a brief moment. "The concept that we lose our individuality is a nonsense. We are already connected to each other. We live in vast communities, each with their own identity, its own consciousness. Millions strong and producing a net product that is far greater than that which any one member could create."

"That is my concept of God, Charles. Not some dude with a beard on a cloud. But the consciousness of the community." She shocked me then, I can tell you. The only angle I was expecting God to come into this, was from me, to include those who felt that Gray represented something that excluded God. She continued, "together we are a vast organism, not a collection of individuals. Our heroes are mythic, our geniuses are metaphysical, they are just simple examples that people throw up by chance to help our small minds understand the progress we are making."

"Progress is not due to the genius of individuals; that is an almost laughable concept when you think of it. We don't find some tiny tribe in some jungle somewhere who owns nuclear fusion reactors due to the guy in the end hut who is a whizz with math and engineering, or some hermit in the mountains who has surpassed the artistic achievements of Rome, or China or 20th Century America, because he is great at telling a story or a dab hand with a brush. Sure we love a hero. But the individuals we believe are the spark of civilisation and have produced our progress, are impostors who take ownership of the achievements of the community they dwell in. Edison, Einstein, Jobs or Oppenheimer, each is like an ancient king attributed with invention by scribes who wrote neat and simple histories: they tell us an easy lie, but the truth is that many did the work, and they just presented the result. We love the concept of course; it paints for us the art of the possible; that, if we all work hard, and work with each other, we may be the next Newton, the next Gates, and own the result. But at the end of it, it is a fraud. All that invention is the work of God: the God we all become when we all are connected." Gray fell into silence. A man and a girl stopped in front of us. He lifted her up onto his shoulders so she could see across the river, at the City on the other bank, and they blocked the reflected glare the buildings there. For that moment, an uneasy tension sat between us there on the bench.

I watched the streams of people walking along the river bank and across the foot bridge further down. I saw something then, beyond, in that scene. At a distance those people appeared uniform, their actions following a collective trend. They moved with a loose purpose, not random, not chaotic. Only when one of these walked close to us did the person emerge, the detail, the individual. Maybe this was what she meant.

"What has being connected meant for you, Gray?" I broke the silence. She turned to me and brushed off some dust on the bottom of her jeans and from the toe of her shoe. Her sunglasses were so dark I couldn't tell if she was looking at me or not. "I'm not giving you my life story Godwin," she said, still looking my way. "I'm not asking for that," I said. "For me to get a better picture of how this works, maybe so I can dispel some of the fears, I need to know how it works."

She laughs and easy laugh. "Let's walk," and she got up and started walking down the river. As I walked along side her her shoulder touched mine. More than once the back of her hand brushed mine as it swung in time with her stride. "I've never been easy with words. Oh, look I've got a great vocabulary and all that, it was just it was always an effort to speak to someone. I'd fall into silences or mumble, because the physical effort of actually speaking used to wear me down.  I read that article about the stuff Bright Futures was doing and I enlisted in their test programme.

"Nothing happened for nearly two years. Then I get this email to get in touch. I was on the list. They flew me out to San Francisco and poked and prodded me to see if I was healthy. Then a week later I signed about a novel's length set of papers signing my life away, and all that. The next day, they shaved my head and stuck a Gate in. Easy as.

"There were five of us in the study group. Two ladies and three gents. It was pretty boring stuff. Crappy stuff like moving a cursor on a screen, playing Pong, for fuck sake. The fear at first was about sensory overload. But that was bullshit. All five of us knew that. The brain is overexposed every waking moment and never skips a beat. Anyhow, we were all bored and spending a lot of time together. Bright Futures' campus was in the middle of a parking lot in San Carlos, south of San Fran. There is, like, nothing there. It's the 'burbs and there is not even any sidewalks, when we did go for a walk, these people would stare at us from their porches or out of windows. Mind you we all wore overalls and had skinhead haircuts, so we probably didn't look great. The campus was pretty flash though with a great cafeteria. Great food, with salads and fresh fruit. No expense spared. See, when you spend a lot of time together, doing the same things, we got pretty close. We still are.

Anyway, we were chilling out after another gruelling session, wired up, playing Pong, when one of us, Simon said we should do something a bit more fun. Simon was one of these people who usually said nothing. I guessed at the time he struggled with speaking more than I did. He seemed nice enough, laughed at jokes, always said 'hello', but not much else. Anyway, he sat there and said, 'This is bullshit. I'm bored out of my fucking mind here. Hey, I mean, we're not even connected to the fucking Internet. So, yesterday, when you guys were filling your faces, I got a taxi and went out. Went to this electronics shop I know. They sell spook stuff, you know for spying on your neighbours, or perving at the girl in the apartment opposite. Anyhow, I made this.' and he dropped this cable on the table. We all starred at it. I picked it up. One end was a USB plug that would go into most phones, the other an odd plug like we saw in the lab. In the middle of the cable was a box, carefully covered in electrical tape. The cable was about six feet long. 'What's in the box?' I asked. Simon picked up the box and looked at it. 'I reckon it's just what we need, Gray. Hopefully no one is going to get mad when they find this is missing.' Simon dropped another cable on the table. This one was straight from the labs. Bright orange, more professional looking than the first. The box at the one end had been cut open and the moulded plug cut off. It had been taped up, neatly enough, but the cutting had left the once neat construction looking rough. The orange cable also had a USB plug on it, it too had been cut off and reattached. Simon placed the two boxes next to each other. 'The box has a small video card in it. It is programmed to translate the signals into the Gate. They left the firmware on the video card, so I could copy it. It's all pretty open. Anyway, the programme is pretty simple and me and the friend at the shop managed to reverse engineer it. We tweaked it so we should be able to get the box to translate IP traffic, using your phone as a mobile hotspot. Who wants to test it?'

"Everyone at that table looked down and said nothing. The idea of sticking in some hack-job cable in my Gate wasn't something I fancied doing. 'Okay, okay, I'll do it. Jesus you're all pussies. No trust in anyone," Simon said. So we followed him to his room. He sat on the swivel chair all our rooms had. 'Gray, plug this in.' He handed me the homemade cable. 'Plug the right end in, okay?' He seemed so relaxed, so accepting of the risks. I slotted the one end into his Gate and turned it until I heard the familiar 'click'. 'Okay,' said Simon, 'here goes nothing.' He took the USB end and slid it into his phone. He closed his eyes. I was holding my breath. I glanced at the others in the room, everyone was staring at Simon, their faces a mixture of fascination and horror. Simon was still. I held myself still and waited to see his chest rise and fall. He was still alive, at least. His eyes opened. He pulled out the cable from his phone. 'Please, Gray, take it out.' I twisted the cable out and pulled it away. Simon stood up. He walked to his bed. Sam, the other lady of the group, took his arm and he lay down. 'Are you okay, Simon?' There was an edge of panic to her voice. We were are terrified. 'I'm fine. I'm exhausted. That was so very hard. But I was connected to the Internet.' Alan, the oldest member of our group, laughed first. 'What did you look at, Simon, pornhub?' We all laughed.

"Alan, was the best software developer of the group. He'd written firmware while working at a number of flashy places over the years, such as the likes of Apple, Tesla and Amazon. He was in his mid-forties, bald and a bit fat. I can't think of anyone more 'geek' than Alan. He and Simon took the cable connector and made a work of art. Meanwhile, we all learnt how to connect. After a while, the initial exhaustion that slammed you flat each time you tried to make progress, lessened. Soon enough we could message each other, and friends and family without having to touch our phones. We kept it a secret at first from the Bright Futures technicians. We knew we had breached a number of their policies and our contracts. But it became harder to do. All of our scores went off the charts. Anything they threw at us we could do. After the effort of manipulating a means of interaction with the Internet, their stuff was so simple. So we told them. Well Sam did. Fed up with more repetitious tests in the lab, she pulled out her cable and plugged herself into her phone. She sent all the lab techs a message, right there, right then. 'See no hands!!'"

We had walked along way down the South Bank as Gray's story had unfolded. We were now in the old part of London and beginning to press towards Tower Bridge. The sun had started to slip across the sky. A pub's occupants spilled across the footpath and laughed raucously, filled with beer and sun. "Where do want to go from here? I'm hungry, do you want something to eat? I still want to know about Consensus." Gray looked at the pub and up at the bright sign above us, filled with light blue shirts and chinos and sun-red faces. "Not here, though, please," she said. "I'd expect somewhere classy from a man like you Mr Godwin."

We walked up to the road behind the pub and I went to hail a cab. A car pulled up next to us as I went to raise my arm. The door opened, "Welcome Gray, please can you tell me your destination", the vehicle calmly. I looked at her, "What? I called it a minute ago. You said you were hungry." We laughed and got into the car. "Can you take us to Great Portland Street," I told the car. "I hope you like curry." The car pulled away.

The car pulled over and the door opened. "Gray, you account will be debited for twelve pounds and sixty pence. This will be charged in US dollars on your statement. I hope you have a good day." We got out, the door closed and the car pulled away into the traffic. "Can you remember the cabbies?" Gray frowned at me. "Perhaps not. Cabbies are, were, London taxi drivers. Here they used to have to do this test, called 'The Knowledge'. They did some scientific studies of it. Debunked the idea that our brains stop developing when we reach about twenty. These cabbies brains were hugely different after learning all that information on how to navigate London streets and what was the quickest route from one place to another. you used to see them whizzing about, in all weather, on scooters, learning the streets. Sad really. They've all gone now." As I spoke we had walked done a side street and into a cobbled mews, closed at the end. Have way along I opened a door. Above a camera flashed a small green light. Inside we climbed up a staircase and it opened out into a large apartment. "Is this your place, Godwin?" "It is," I told her. "I told you, you weren't my type." I smiled. "I know, but you said take you somewhere classy: my home." I theatrically spread my arms out to take in the space.

 we are connected

I had a nice fish masala knocked up in no time. A rice cooker helped with the rice - I can't see why anyone would not own one. I then rolled out some dough I had mixed together earlier and cooked the chapatis on a hot frying pan. Gray was lounging back on the sofa with a bottle of beer in her hand. Somehow, I could tell she was not alone. "Let's eat, Gray." I loaded the table up with stuff I'd cooked. I was pretty happy with it. "Is it good?" I asked. "Hey give me a chance, Charles, it looks good though, I wouldn't have thought." She scooped up a piece of fish with her bread. "Hmmm, mmmh, yep, that's good." She ate quickly and neatly. We didn't say much. I was pleased the food had gone down well. She sat back and sipped from her beer bottle. "Let's go and relax. This can wait." I gestured at the dishes on the table. I grabbed another couple of beers from the fridge and flopped down on he sofa with Gray.

"So, let's continue then. As I said, there were five of us. Bright Futures was initially a bit pissed at the whole Internet connection to the brain thing. They were hardcore science nuts, we were messing with their experiment. But, they came round after a bit. They looked at the cables and worked with Alan and Simon on the firmware. Then Brandon, the other member of our little gang, floated the idea of us directly connecting. Until that point we were pretty good on the Internet, but we weren't really any different in the way we used it from anyone else, just faster. Brandon thought if we could push the raw data through a connection, without it being translated to IP, we could get more through it. Brain to brain so to speak." Gray laughed at that, as if sharing a private joke. "It's pretty basic computer science really,' she continued. "One system interfaces to another generally through an agreed means of translation. This is fine, but limits the scope of what can be shared. Add new types of data in one system and you may not be able to share it with another, without first changing the translation layer. So, change is expensive. Now if we could know that both systems are identical, with the same processes and architecture, we could lose the translation layer entirely. The data could be raw and not narrowed down by rigid structures. Surely, one brain could interpret data from another brain, if you can get that data into it.

"Meanwhile, one of the Bright Futures techs comes to see us. She was all excited, in one had she held one the cables we were using to get online. In the other a flat round lump of metal, about the size of a hockey puck, about three inches across. 'Who wants to try this bad boy?' He says to us. 'You can have this,' and hold up the trailing orange cable, with its box and letting the cable ends hang onto the floor. 'Or this,' and holds up the puck. The technician, Siobhan, had managed to make the cable wireless and connect to a 5G connection. Sam volunteered. Siobhan removed an inner part of the Gate, the data socket and screwed in the Puck, as we called it. She pressed a button, and a tiny light came on. 'Listen, there's a 100Wh battery in there. If you thrash it, both the battery and the video card will heat up. So you'll basically cook your brain. Have fun.' A huge grin spread across Sam's face. She span around, laughing. Each of our phones pinged as messages hit them. 'Look, no hands, no cable. It's magic ma!' the messages read. Sam was online. She could go anywhere now and be connected. She then said, 'Jesus it's heavy though. I'll end up with neck muscles like Gray, carrying this around all day. Good work Siobhan, but needs work. I bet we don't need the fancy high density battery for a start.'"







Connected increases my sapience not my sentience. Look it up.


How connected consensus works. The analogy of the pull request, but in real-time and fast. The connection of feelings not just language.

Ends with consensus is reached. They will.

 reputation

The connected group feel that while they want to help Kia, she has to help them too. This is the new world: you must enhance your reputation, to do this you must participate. Think of this like a tutorial leading you through a set of steps to gain badges for online interactions. It is a led activity, but one you need to do in order to gain access to higher levels. You need to show competency.

This time, due to the circumstances there is a time-limit for Kia. A clock starts to tick that will mean that she will be excluded from the very thing that she has always wanted - a family to belong to.

To do this she needs to challenge her own interaction with the world. To become more honest with herself and Not have such high expectations of others.

It starts well enough, but as the levels get harder and harder she finds herself falling back into old patterns. She starts to resent the challenge and starts to resent the Gate as the answer.

Ends with Lia

 old days connections

Sally and her mother re-connect. It is beautiful.

But the lack of control Joan has over Sally and all that is happening makes her bitter. She hates the digital means of connecting to Sally, worse though she has lost her immediate role of what she sees is a mother: a guide and instructor, someone who tells the child what she needs to do.

"Put these on," Melvin stands over Joan, holding a large, black pair of goggles.
"What are they?"
"Virtual reality goggles. I want to show you something."
"Really?" Impatient and patronising she sighs as she reaches out from the smooth matt black goggles. "What do I do, just put them on?"
"Yes, just put them on. It will be dark. Push the ear piece into your ear."
Another sigh and slips the goggles over her head. There is nothing to see. She pushes the earpieces into her ears. *This better be good.*
"Hello mum."
"Who's that?"
"It's me, Sally."
"Oh God! You can speak now? My baby!" Tears pooled along the edges of her eyes, causing a sprinkling of tiny lights across her vision.
"I can speak mum. Relax. Are you ready?"
"For what, baby?"
"For me!" Another light at the centre of her vision appeared. She blinked rapidly. Her hand reached out and waved urgently at the outside room.
"What is it? Sally, sweetheart?" The light grew from the point in front of her and started to form a shape. A distant figure was moving towards her. It moved like a mirage, waving in an imagined haze. Then it became solid, a person, a girl. Sally.
Joan ripped the googles from her head. The one ear-piece tugging hard at her ear, stinging.
"What is this dad? God what is this?" The googles fell the floor. Joan's hands covered her face as if in terror at what could be seen. She sobbed; her shoulders moving up and down in sharp spasms of grief.
Grandad stooped to rescue the fallen goggles and quickly swung them up onto his own head. He afixed the ear-pieces.
"Sally? I'm sorry. Your mum got a shock."
"Is she okay?" The little girl stood there, in her favourite blue and grey dress, upon a black plain with no obvious end. Her dark hair was perfectly combed into two neat bunches either side of her head, each held in place with a matching blue bow.
"Sure, she's fine. Just a shock. We should have warned her it would happen. Silly really. Hey that dress is going to getting too small isn't it. That's what you wore at your mum's birthday three years ago!"
"It's mum's favourite. Mine too. I wore last summer, before I was sick." She smiled, an uncertain smile.
"Hey! Look at you with your new smile. I bet that dress was a struggle to get into last summer!" He laughed out loud.
He felt a touch on his arm and removed the googles. Joan was looking up at him, her eyes wet and puffy with her make smudged. "Hang on, Sally."
"I'm sorry." Joan said, "I don't know. Is it really her? I can't see her like this." She sniffed dabbing at her smeary eyes.
"She cannot see you yet. We are working on it. She says she looks at a picture she has for each of us, so I guess it's like Skype when one person has their video turned off. Here, try again." He offered the goggles to her and she took them. Grandad helped her put them on and insert the ear-pieces.
"Hello sweetheart. Sorry, you gave mum such a fright."
"It's okay mum." She laughed.
"You monkey, you think it's funny making your mum scared like that!" She laughed too; they both laughed together for the first time for a long time.
"Do you like my my dress? Grandad said it would be too small now. But I can do anything here!" She stuck her tongue out. "That's to grandad!" and she laughed again.
"The dress looks lovely. You ignore grandad, sometimes he's just rude! I love the way you've done your hair - very cute." Joan felt herself tighten up, she so just wanted to hold her child, pick up the cute little girl before her. She felt her hands go out in a mock cuddle. "Do you know what I am doing?"
"No, what?" Sally grinned.
"I'm giving you a big cuddle." Tears started to flow again and Sally was blurred through the wet of her eyes.
"I'd like that. Grandad's friend says we can work on that. I can see hear and see now."
"I'd love that too. For now we'll just have to imagine."
"Okay."
"You know what?"
"What?"
"Grandad's right. That dress would never do up!"
"Mum!"
"What? You're ten now! Big girl."

 bad old days

Is is about 10 o'clock in the morning when Joan knocks on the door. There was no answer from the doorstairs intercom. She knows her mother rarely goes out, so either the intercom is not working or she is drunk and asleep. A old woman with tightly permed, almost orange, hair had come out of the lobby door and Joan had gone in and up in the lift.

It takes nearly five minnutes for Viv to come to the door. Joan had banged urgently on the door and yelled in a hushed tone through the letterbox. "Mum, let me in." She felt the hotness of her skin as she had thought of the people in the apartment block listening to her try to rouse her mother.

The door opens. "Joan! This is a lovely surprise. Sorry I was in the shower and couldn't have heard you." Viv stands there in her lurid pink and yellow dressing-gown that gaped awkwardly. Her skin and hair perfectly dry. She is heavily made up, but it is smudgy and poorly applied. "Come in, come in. Do you want a drink?"
"Tea. Do you have any milk?"
"Of course, I think. Let me check." Vi hustles down the corridor into the kitchen at the end of the hallway. "No, love. Sorry. How about coffee then?"
"Okay." Joan walks into the living room, not following her mother. The room is messy, with magazines and free papers on the floor. It is arranged as if the furniture had slid from side to side, like on a boat in a swelling sea, and settled at a point once the motion had stopped. A low coffee table lies close to a lounge chair, on it is a cushion with a bright knitted cover lined up with the chair. Across the table were drinks glasses and an overflowing ashtray. Opposite this a huge television that dominated the room.
Vi walks in with two large mugs of black coffee. She offers Joan one, hesitates then offers her the other.
"Thanks." Joan takes the mug and sits on the edge of the sofa that is at an awkward angle to everything else in the room.
"You're welcome. So good to see you. Do you like my new TV? Melvin bought it, I believe. Turned up one day. I told the delivery man to take it away, horrible thing. So vulgar! But he insisted and so here it is. How is your father?"
"He's good. He's happy that we've managed to reach Sally and we can now communicate with her."
"Does he know you've come to see me?"
"It's none of his business who I see, mum."
"So you're not happy then. You only come to see me if you're unhappy. When you're happy and things are good, I never see you from one month to the next." Vi sips from her coffee cup and looks over it at Joan who is looking down at the thick carpet that needs a clean.
"So," Vi smiles, "you're not happy at the situation you've got yourself in, are you sweetheart."
"What situation, mum?" Joan's voices is soft and quiet.
"Sally of course. You let them do that to her. How could you? You know it's wrong, poor baby. You've seen what they have been saying on the TV. I was talking to Mrs Hawkins downstairs - funny lady, younger than me if you can believe it. Well, she has her granddaughter around all the time, like I used to. I couldn't now could I, not now Sally is, well, you know."
Joan reached across and put her cup down on the coffee table. Vi placed her hand on Joan's arm and says, "It's not right, Joan. It's not natural. I mourned her when she died and now I hear she's back on a computer. They say so on TV. It's more than I can take." Vi takes a gulp from the coffee cup and looks at the TV accusingly.
"She didn't die, mum, for Christ's sake! She's alive. She's just, well," her voice trailing away as she pinches her lips together, her eyes wet.
"I had a gentleman caller, Joan! I forgot to say."
"Nobody says that, mum, 'a gentleman caller'. You sound like you're living in nineteen-fifty."
"More's the pity we're not. Those were better days, I can tell you," Vi says as she swills the rest of the coffee cup's contents into her thin mouth.
"Hmmm, because you were a small child then." Joan looks about the room, her arm following her gaze. "Not much has changed really though I guess, just no one about to pick up after you."
Vi's face hardens. "Don't come the smart-arse with me, girl. You come here and laugh at me? You're disgusting, what you've done. Charles agrees with me. What a lovely man, the kind that would sort you out and your 'daddy' issues. He said..."
"Who's Charles?"
"Charles Godwin, you must have seen him on TV."
"I haven't been watching much TV mum, I've been busy, if you didn't notice."
"I wouldn't know, sweetheart. I only know what is going on from the TV. No one tells me anything. Anyway he said that people were doing unnatural things. This was against nature, against God."
Joan laughs a tight and bitter laugh. "God, really? Since when did you start believing in God?"
"There's lots of things you don't know about me," Vi snaps. "You think you know everything. But you don't. If you did you wouldn't have done that to my granddaughter. Charles said that you've been tricked. There is this organisation, Brighter Future they're called, who are trying to make new humans. An army of zombie-like people to take over the world. They have done this to Sally."
"What are you talking about? Fucking zombies - mum really?"
"It's true, I tell you. Charles and some other people are trying to stop them before it's too late. If they don't, one day we'll all wake up and these people will be in charge - it's like Nazi Germany, these people are trying to make a master race." Vi stopped. "How do you feel about Sally? Are you happy with how she is? You can't be. I'm not. It's horrible. That's not living. It's a computer game. Like those ones that kids spend all their time playing, rather than going outside and meeting real people. What sort of life is she going to have? None." Vi is on a roll, now. Her monologue seems not really meant for Joan, who is sinking into her seat as if crushed by the onslaught of thoughtless words. "What happens when she is a teenager, that's not long away? She meets noone her age. She can't, can she? She's a zombie. They can do some cruel things nowadays, in the name of medical science. Progress they call it. I call it abomination! Poor girl, she has become a circus freak. People are using her and you're letting them. I wasn't much of a mother, but I'd never have allowed that."

Joan stands up, her head swimming so she has to lean down to steady herself with a hand. Vi leans her hand down to the side of her chair and picks up another mug. She drinks from it, staring at the television. "I'm off, mother. I'll let my self out." She moves out of the room and towards the front the door.
"Do that," Vi says. She takes another gulp from the new cup and picks up the TV remote.
Joan walks out of the apartment, the sound of the too loud TV is silenced with the slam of the door.

 consensus failure

Charles Godwin gives an interview. His narcissism completely derails his intended message.

Godwin meets with his group. They attack him. The terror of a hidden hand at work unpicks them, the irony of their own image being projected and then reflected back is heavy here.

The group splinter. Godwin is left berating the others, but they have already left.

Ends with a summary of scathing social media reaction and backlash.

 connection bonds


Melvin decides that to help Sally further he needs to better understand her situation and better connect to her.

Ends with Melvin in Shanghai to see Dr Li.

 self connection required

Lia has done little to address the issues that Gray said she needs to in order to make better use of her connectedness.

Ends that she decides to leave her Gate turned off.

 upgrade path


[Godwin wraps up and claims a victory.]

So, that is my story. Or is is my story of the stories that make up what happened. I think you will agree that they are complete and that they are a better version than that played out in the media, for the lurid and sensational reasons that it had.

The future. Does it belong to likes of Lia and Gray, or to Melvin? Is it a Bright Futures future where the likes of Raphaella plays God to us mortals? Where in this future is there a place for Joan, or even Vi? Where is my place?

My future is missing Sally. I think that in my future there is no Sally. In my future Sally is already in another future, she will be outside of our time. The horror of her life is a thing of the past; her life now, if that is how we describe it, is something else, something none of us who shared here can understand. She is now inscrutable, we cannot imagine or empathise with her thoughts as they are so different from us. She is an exotic intelligence.
