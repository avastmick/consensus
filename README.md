Her despairing grandfather and grieving mother question the options offered to them. Will saving her life in fact mean losing her? Are interested parties using her situation for their own ends?

The best (well, easiest) way to contribute is using [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/avastmick/consensus). Download the editor and push up you changes and I will review (or whoever would like to take over).

I'll post up more detailed instructions here as I get it all bedded in.
