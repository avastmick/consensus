# consensus 

The world is in turmoil at the technology that is encroaching upon our biology. At the centre of events is a dangerously sick young girl. Her despairing grandfather and grieving mother question the options offered to them. Will saving her life in fact mean losing her? Are interested parties using her situation for their own ends?

## Contribution

The best (well, easiest) way to contribute is using [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/avastmick/consensus). Sign-up, download the editor and make changes then push up you changes and I will review (or whoever would like to take over).

This is the `master` branch and is for information only. All changes should be made on the `edit` branch, with pull requests (for updates) to go into the `draft` branch.

If you are more technical, please use a typical git workflow. Only do this if you _are_ technical and know what `git` is:

```bash
# Fork the https://github.com/avastmick/consensus repo
git clone https://github.com/[your_username]/consensus.git
cd consensus
git checkout edit
# make changes
git commit -am 'Made some changes'
git push
# Create pull request [your_username]/consensus/edit -> avastmick/consensus/edit
# Rinse and repeat
```

I'll post up more detailed instructions here as I get it all bedded in.
