# Foreword

Books that concern themselves with the future are always in danger of making themselves a mockery. In particular, this is true of books that describe the near future, so I am putting myself, deliberately, in a situation where derision is likely. To lessen the inevitable effects, I have taken some precautions to help avoid almost immediate anachronism.

Firstly, this book is not intended to be prophetic. I have no crystal ball. Secondly, the time it is set is uncertain. I suggest it could be set anywhere from five to twenty years in the future. Lastly, I have based the science of currently existing technology: that is to say, that every gadget and device already exists in 2017 in some form or other and that their concept has already been proven.

I hope you enjoy it, and are not too dismissive if my depiction of the future is not quite right.
