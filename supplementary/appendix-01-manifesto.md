Not if, but when this has been done we will be programmable, and able to bypass the learning process, man/woman kind will then start the AI journey, it is inevitable and imminent. 

There is lots of guff on this site and in particular in the comments - people using big words, referring to big philosophies, demanding that all of it is underpinned by a big mystery.
